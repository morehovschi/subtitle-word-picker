"""
This command line app looks through a set of subtitle files (.srt files in data/)
and, for a chosen document (corresponding to a movie or an episode), displays the
top N words ranked by TF-IDF. Once a word is chosen, contextual examples of the word
from the given document are displayed.

The app is intended for language learners who want learn a set of words (as well as
their associated contexts) ahead of watching the movie or episode.
