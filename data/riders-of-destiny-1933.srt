00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,655
[SINGING] A cowboy sang his
song of fate as he wandered

3
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:08,448
the desert wide, his eyes were
burning with flames of hate

4
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:14,758
and his guns were loaded
with poison bait, as they

5
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:23,517
hung and swung at his side.

6
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,517
An outlaw had stolen his gal
away, an outlaw bold and fly,

7
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,862
so hot on the tail of
the outlaw's trail,

8
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:44,344
this cowboy rode ready to die.

9
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,551
Grease up your guns, outlaw,
and cinch them on tight,

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,931
there'll be blood
a-running in town

11
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:55,620
before night, there'll be
guns a-blazing and singing

12
00:01:55,724 --> 00:02:00,241
with lead, tonight
you'll be drinking

13
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:05,758
your drinks with the dead.

14
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:43,793
Shot in the back, eh?

15
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:44,931
Yeah.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,310
Now, don't try
to talk, Sheriff.

17
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:16,000
That's a nasty wound.

18
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:16,862
Stopped bleeding, though.

19
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:19,413
That's something.

20
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,724
Aw, you're going
to be all right.

21
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:23,793
I'll have you in
Starbuck before night.

22
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,413
Just a swallow, now.

23
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:30,482
You can have more later.

24
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,862
[coughing]

00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:09,620

[gunfire]

27
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:22,724
We got him.

28
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,413
Well, are you hurt, Miss?

29
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,689
I don't think so.

30
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,034
Are they coming?

31
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,103
They're almost here.

32
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:17,517
They mustn't take me.

33
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:19,034
Really, they mustn't.

34
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,482
Please don't let them.

35
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,689
I'm not a bandit.

36
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:23,275
Really I'm not.

37
00:05:23,344 --> 00:05:26,275
You see--

38
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:27,931
Hey, hey-- this is the
best place here, Elmer.

39
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:28,758
Give me a push.

40
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,379
Hey-- get off my neck!

41
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,172
Don't you understand?

42
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,137
It was our only way out.

43
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,275
Won't you please help me?

44
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,448
Well, I'll do what I
can do for you, Miss.

45
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,000
But your horse is done for.

46
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,862
Well, you'll have to take mine.

47
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:00,413
Hey, why don't
you stay up there?

48
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,551
I'll have your horse in
town for you in an hour.

49
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,931
You've got his horse, Bert.

50
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,931
Yeah.

51
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,413
Too bad I didn't
get the road agent.

52
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:44,862
Well, he can't get far.

53
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:52,517
[gunshot]

54
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:55,517
We got him.

55
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:05,896
We lost him.

56
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:06,551
Yeah.

57
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,689
You go that way.

58
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,206

Oh.

62
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,413
Aw, come on, Bert.

63
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,000
This ain't getting us nowhere.

64
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:05,413
Dad-- I got it.

65
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:06,689
You got what?

66
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,620
Where in the world
have you been?

67
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:10,068
I beat the robbers to it.

68
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,724
I held up the stage,
and I got our money.

69
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,379
You-- you held up the stage?

70
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,310
Why, I never--

71
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:16,448
Pop, don't get excited.

72
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:19,413
It's all over, and I'm safe.

73
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:20,793
But I lost Prince.

74
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,965
They shot him from under me.

75
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,482
And if it hadn't been for a
stranger lending me his horse,

76
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,275
well, I guess I'd
be in jail by now.

77
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,241
A stranger?

78
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,448
Wha-- well, who was he?

79
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,620
I don't know.

80
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:32,655
But he sure was swell.

81
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:33,793
I've got to change
my clothes and get

82
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,413
his horse back into town.

83
00:09:35,482 --> 00:09:38,620
I never heard of anything like
that before in all my life.

84
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:53,931
Hie!

85
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:00,724
The boys are sure late.

86
00:10:00,793 --> 00:10:03,793
I wonder if anything's happened?

87
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:04,931
Here she comes now.

88
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,517
Put down them irons.

89
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,689
There ain't no passengers.

90
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,103
Well, hand down the bag.

91
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,103
You're late now.

92
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,241
There ain't no bag.

93
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:32,137
A masked rider held us
up about two miles back.

94
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:33,310
What'll the boss say?

95
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:34,724
We can't help what he says.

96
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:37,758
It ain't our fault.

97
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,344
Well, we'll see you in town.

98
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,793
All right.

99
00:10:40,896 --> 00:10:42,965
Giddyup there-- ha-- ha!

100
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:52,896
[galloping hooves]

101
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,379
Well, Pete, we got
stucked up again.

102
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,275
PETE: Where did it happen?

103
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:32,758
Down by big Rock Canyon.

104
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:34,344
What kind of a
horse was he riding?

105
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:35,724
BERT: A bay.

106
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,655
Uh, we shot the horse,
but the rider got away.

107
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:41,206
KINCAID: Well, you might trace
the brand and find the owner.

108
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,172
By George, we never thought
to look at the brand.

109
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:45,413
We'll ride up there,
and see what we can find.

110
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,206
Oh, how do you do, Miss Denton?

111
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,206
How's your father?

112
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,379
Better, thank you.

113
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:55,482
Oh, Pete-- was there a
package for me today?

114
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:56,517
There was.

115
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,448
But the stage was held up.

116
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,827
Again?

117
00:11:59,931 --> 00:12:00,931
Where's the Sheriff?

118
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,586
He hasn't got back yet.

119
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,448
You know, he went out to try and
break up this road agent gang.

120
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:07,586
We haven't been
able to find him.

121
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:09,172
Can I be of any assistance?

122
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:12,551
Well, my horse and saddle
were stolen last night.

123
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,517
I thought maybe he might be
able to help me find them.

124
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,241
What color was your horse?

125
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:19,965
He was a sort of a bay,
with a Double-O brand.

126
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:23,103
Well, there was a horse of
that description just shot.

127
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,448
Oh.

128
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,206
I hope it wasn't mine.

129
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:29,379
If it was, Miss Denton, I'll
bring your saddle to you.

130
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,206
Thank you.

131
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:39,862
Howdy, folks.

132
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:42,241
Could you tell me
where the Sheriff is?

133
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,413
Well, I take charge
when he isn't here.

134
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:47,413
Can I do anything for you?

135
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:48,275
Thanks.

136
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:49,896
I'll wait for him.

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,931
The Sheriff didn't care
especially for this job.

138
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,827
He might not come back.

139
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,103
I'll take that chance.

140
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:59,344
I have an idea he
will come back.

141
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:14,310
I don't like the way
that fellow talks.

142
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,448
We'll watch him.

143
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,724
Meet me at the crossroads,
and I'll take you home.

144
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:29,896
All right.

145
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,793
That masked bandit story
was on the square, huh?

146
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,103
Yeah.

147
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,482
He got us two miles
ahead of the boys here.

148
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,103
Well, he's afoot now.

149
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,482
The only place he can get
water is at Denton's, or town.

150
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,896
We may get him.

151
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,241
Let's have a look at that horse.

152
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:31,482
We'd better put your
horse in the barn.

153
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:32,689
That's a good idea.

154
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,034
I reckon he's pretty dry.

155
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:46,724
You were right.

156
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,862
He is thirsty.

157
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:49,827
Come on.

158
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:50,793
I want you to meet my dad.

159
00:14:50,896 --> 00:14:51,620
Why, sure.

160
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,517
I'd be glad to.

161
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,310
Dad, I want you to
meet Mr. Saunders.

162
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,482
I want to thank you,
young fellow, for what

163
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,724
you done for my daughter.

164
00:15:06,827 --> 00:15:09,620
Well, forget it, but, uh,
what's happened to you?

165
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:10,620
Sit down.

166
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:11,551
I'll tell you all about it.

167
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,413
Thank you.

168
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:19,413
You see, Fay and me own half
interest in the mine at Yucca.

169
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:23,137
Our partner sends us our
share every couple of weeks.

170
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,931
Sometimes it's
only a few dollars.

171
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,965
Other times, it's a few hundred.

172
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:29,896
He always writes us
when to expect it.

173
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,241
And almost always,
the stage was held up

174
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,620
when the shipment came through.

175
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,482
One day, we discovered our
letters were being opened.

176
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,137
They knew just when
the money was coming.

177
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:42,793
So I decided to
follow the stage.

178
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:44,241
Heh.

179
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,241
I ran into the hold-up,
and got a slug in my hip.

180
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,241
Today, Fay thought
she'd beat them to it.

181
00:15:52,344 --> 00:15:53,206
Hm.

182
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,275
That's when you
happened into it.

183
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:09,793
It's Kincaid, with my saddle.

184
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:10,689
Wait here.

185
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:11,758
I'll get him on his way.

186
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:21,103
It was your horse,
all right, Miss Denton.

187
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,862
Here's your saddle.

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,793
Thank you so much.

189
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:25,034
Not at all.

190
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:27,482
Bert-- take it out to the barn.

191
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,344
Never mind.

192
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:29,172
Don't trouble.

193
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,517
When your father's
feeling better,

194
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,206
I'd like to talk to him
about buying your ranch.

195
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,000
He's too ill to talk now.

196
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,586
Give him my regards.

197
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:05,413
Thank you.

198
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:06,241
I will.

199
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:20,310
Hey, Chief.

200
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,862
You know that hombre what
was looking for the Sheriff?

201
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,068
Yes.

202
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:33,827
Well, his horse is
in Denton's barn.

203
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:36,586
I wonder what his game is?

204
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,655
Well, whatever it is, we'll
put a stop to it right here.

205
00:17:40,758 --> 00:17:41,896
You boys wait here.

206
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,689
He's got to come
along this road.

207
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:46,034
Accidents will happen.

208
00:17:46,103 --> 00:17:47,068
I get you.

209
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,689
What about the Sheriff?

210
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,000
Can't he do something?

211
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:01,793
It's mighty strange,
but Bill Baxter's gone.

212
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:06,758
He's the second Sheriff
to disappear in a year.

213
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:08,275
He was a fine man.

214
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:09,689
And our friend.

215
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:12,517
Well, why is Kincaid so
anxious to buy your ranch?

216
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:15,517
He's trying to buy
up all the ranches.

217
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,586
And he's offering the boys the
ridiculous price of $1 an acre.

218
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:23,862
He owns the water
rights to Lost Creek.

219
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,965
You see, Lost Creek comes up
and disappears on his land.

220
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:32,896
And he supplies the whole
country hereabouts with water.

221
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,517
That's why he's so independent.

222
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,517
No one will fight him, for fear
he'll shut off their supply.

223
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:40,344
I'm the only one
can talk back to him.

224
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,344
I've got the only well
in Antelope Valley.

225
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:48,172
The boys are holding a
meeting in town today.

226
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,448
I'll tell you, men, we're
getting a rotten deal.

227
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:56,551
Forced to sell our land
for nothing, or no water.

228
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,310
I'll fight first.

229
00:18:58,413 --> 00:19:00,068
But he's got real gunmen.

230
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,379
What about our families?

231
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,655
Oh, you can't
start a fight now.

232
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,586
Give Washington a chance
to answer our letters.

233
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,034
They're bound to send somebody
out here to investigate

234
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,206
Baxter's disappearance.

235
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,758
That's right.

236
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:16,172
Well, let's wait until we see
what he says when he learns

237
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:17,827
we've decided not to sell.

238
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:18,655
[mutters of approval]

239
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,034
Well, I hope you'll be
feeling better, Mr. Denton.

240
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,344
Thank you.

241
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,724
And I may accept that
invitation of yours

242
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:25,827
to stay here.

243
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:27,000
We'd love to have you.

244
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,172
We sure would, son.

245
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,206
Well, thank you.

246
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:33,551
Goodbye.

247
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:44,172
They may have seen
your horse at the barn.

248
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:47,241
You'll be careful, won't you?

249
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:48,551
I'll be back for dinner.

250
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:00,517
Well, gentlemen?

251
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,068
Have you reached an agreement?

252
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,206
Yes.

253
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,862
We've decided you
can go plum to--

254
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,931
Wait, Mason.

255
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:11,034
Your proposition can treat
us beyond all reason.

256
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,931
We've worked years
for these lands,

257
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,413
and we don't intend to sell
for a few measly dollars.

258
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:16,689
That's your privilege.

259
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:18,241
Don't forget, the
state has deeded

260
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:20,206
me the right to the only
water in this valley.

261
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,551
I've spent hard-earned
money for labor and dams,

262
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,586
and I expect to get it back.

263
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,551
You're getting it
back, ain't you?

264
00:20:26,655 --> 00:20:29,517
We're paying you a big
price for your water now.

265
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:32,068
In three days, my contract to
furnish you with water expires.

266
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,793
You'll either sell at my price,
or pay four times the amount

267
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,241
for water you're paying now.

268
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,862
So settle it among yourselves.

269

[horse's hooves]

Come on.

00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,965
Get together.

[crack]

277
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:55,896
Now you boys are going
for a nice little ride.

278
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:17,103
Mm, hello, Morgan.

279
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,793
Glad you got here.

280
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:19,620
Sit down.

281
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:24,965
What's the trouble?

282
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:26,172
Nothing right now.

283
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:28,965
But anything might happen.

284
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:30,000
I need protection.

285
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:35,103
What's it worth?

286
00:22:35,206 --> 00:22:36,482
Same as before.

287
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,896

you'll be drinking

Who's that?

I don't know.

00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:13,758
Mph.

297
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,068
Huh.

298
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:46,931
What a fine pair of love

Howdy, men.

301
00:23:52,344 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm looking for a Mr. Taylor.

302
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,034
I'm Taylor.

303
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,793
Found this letter a few
miles back, on the road.

304
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,448
Must've been dropped in that
last stagecoach hold-up.

305
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:02,482
Thanks.

306
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,896
Boys, here's our
answer from Washington.

307
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,758
Good.

308
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:12,137
Good.

309
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:15,689
Dear Mr. Taylor-- in answer
to your letter of May the 10th,

310
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,862
please be advised that
we are sending a man

311
00:24:17,965 --> 00:24:21,241
to investigate the situation you
mentioned as soon as possible.

312
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,827
[cheers]

313
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,517
RANCHER 1: I hope
he gets here soon.

314
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,448
RANCHER 2: Now we'll
show Mr. Kincaid.

315
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:33,000
RANCHER 3: This
is our water now.

316
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,620
Plenty of it, too.

317
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:06,275
Oh-- glad to see
you out, Mr. Denton.

318
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,241
Yep.

319
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,896
Feeling better every day.

320
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:12,448
Say, uh, is that
the old creek bed?

321
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,965
Yeah.

322
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:16,000
When I first come here,
it was running water

323
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:18,482
through every ranch
in the valley.

324
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,862
Then it dried up.

325
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:24,965
That's when Kincaid
got the upper hand.

326
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,827
You can't divert
a stream, can you?

327
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:27,517
No.

328
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,862
That's agin' the law.

Well, those water contracts

I think I'll take a run in
town and see what happens.

Yeah, that's a good idea.

Well, gentlemen, it's noon.

My contract with
you has expired.

00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,965
Have you come to any decision?

338
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:17,517
Kincaid, you've got
the soul of a snake.

339
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,724
We won't go into that.

340
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:20,379
This is a business proposition.

Now, what have
you decided to do?

00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,448
Just this-- we are
hanging on to our land,

344
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:31,379
and we are not paying you
your price for your water.

345
00:26:31,448 --> 00:26:32,862
Right.

346
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,862
Then take the consequences.

347
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:36,689
Boys, turn off the water.

Guard my dam.

349
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:41,000
And if anyone sets
foot on my land, shoot.

350

on him for drinking water,

for our stock and families.

got to do something.

I've made them an

Well, why pay them anything?

483

Just drop a charge of
dynamite down their well

484

and collapse it.

485
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,793
They'll have no water, and then,
like the rest of the ranchers,

486
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:50,172
they'll have to sell
out for nothing.

That's an idea.

00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,206
Now listen, boys.

494
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,448
Saunders is working
with us, now.

495
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:44,448
So let bygones be bygones.

496
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:46,689
We're going to blow
up Denton's well.

497
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:50,103
And I want you to get enough
dynamite to collapse it

498
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:52,103
for good.

499
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:56,862
If what you say is true,
Saunders, we'll owe you a lot.

500
00:39:56,965 --> 00:40:00,931
Well, it's a long chance,
but I say, take it.

501
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,448
Well, we were going to
sign the contracts anyway.

502
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,000
So we'll insist on that clause.

503
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,862
Good.

504
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:10,413
[interposing voices]

505
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:14,758
You boys ready?

506
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:16,931
I'll go along and
watch old Denton.

507
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,448
Now, it'll take a
big charge, and--

508
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:21,206
I-- I'll get enough
to blow it to China.

509
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,000
Good.

510
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,344
We're all ready
to sign, Kincaid.

511
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,379
Providing you are
willing to insert

512
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:48,758
a new clause in our contract.

513
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:50,000
What is it?

514
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:55,413
That if you should fail,
at any time during the life

515
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:59,172
of our contract, to
provide us with water,

516
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:05,310
your water rights, and lands,
become community property.

517
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:06,344
Sure.

518
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,000
I'll agree to that.

519
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:08,827
Come on in.

520
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,482
Dad-- Dad-- something
terrible has happened.

521
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,482
Mr. Saunders' real
name is Singing Sandy.

522
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,344
He's a gunman and a killer.

523
00:41:38,482 --> 00:41:40,586
I saw him shoot a man in town.

524
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:43,172
And then he joined
Kincaid's gang.

525
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:45,448
Why, I can't believe it.

526
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:47,827
I heard him tell Kincaid
not to pay us a cent.

527
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:49,310
And he's planning
to blow up our well,

528
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:51,448
so we won't have any water.

529
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:53,482
Oh, blow up our well, eh?

530
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:57,413
We'll see about that.

531
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:58,655
Let's have a look in his room.

532
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:22,310
Why, that's Bill Baxter's star.

533
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:26,793
Maybe he killed the Sheriff.

534
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:38,724
Now, when I get inside,
you boys let it go.

535
00:42:38,862 --> 00:42:40,275
Now, let's do this job right.

536
00:42:40,379 --> 00:42:41,137
Mm-hm.

537
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:42,034
Leave it to us.

538
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:53,896
It's him now.

539
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Don't let on.

540
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:04,965

I just saw Kincaid.

I know you did.

544
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:09,793
I heard everything you said.

545
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:11,551
Well, that must have
been interesting.

546
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,655
We know who you are,
Mr. Singing Sandy.

547
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:16,137
You may be a killer and
do away with Sheriffs,

548
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:18,965
but you ain't never
going to blow up my well.

catches up with us.

Yeah.

Tomorrow, Kincaid's dam will
be nothing but a mud hole.

560
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:06,241
Your well was the
headwaters of Lost Creek.

Yeah.

But Bill Baxter's badge.

00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:13,275
Oh, he made a deputy of
me, not knowing who I was.

564

He'll be here today.

Well, who are you?

I'm called Sandy,
all right, but I

567
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:19,862
was sent here by Washington.

00:53:09,689 --> 00:53:10,586
Yep.

660
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,827
I'm going to Yucca,
to send a wire.

661
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:15,241
Oh.

662
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:17,551
Son, we all make mistakes.

663
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:22,379
And I know somebody that's
taking hers mighty seriously.

664
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:25,241
Do you suppose you
could, eh, go in

665
00:53:25,344 --> 00:53:28,172
and tell her you like her
biscuits or something,

666
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:30,517
to cheer her up a bit?

667
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:32,551
I'm gonna tell her
more than that, Dad.

668
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,379
You're going away-- aren't you?

669
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,517
Yes.

670
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:04,896
I-- I don't want you to.

671
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:06,379
But I'll be back for supper.

672
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:08,758
That is, if you'll bake
me about 100 biscuits.

673
00:54:32,206 --> 00:54:34,137
Gosh.

674
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:37,310
Fay-- where you going?

675
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:39,379
I'm going to bake
a million biscuits!

676
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:41,689
