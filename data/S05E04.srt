﻿1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,958
You've both met bad men before.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,478
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,038
Michael Gray.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,158
You lost all your cousin's money
in America, playing the fool.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,278
And poor old Arthur Shelby

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,158
is afraid his wife will never return.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,638
There's a bullet, and

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
on it is carved the name "McCavern".

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,078
If it's war you want,
it's war you shall have.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,798
I've been talking to the Friends.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,598
One of the Friends is a man.

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,678
He would die without his eyes.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,158
These hands belong to the devil!

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,838
By the time my baby draws its first breath,

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,120
you and I will be done.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,198
And you will be king.

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
Happy or sad, Tommy?

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,320
Mr Shelby.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,600
My bullets ache to get
inside your tinker head.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,638
# Up to our knees in Fenian blood

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,238
# Surrender or you'll die

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,318
# We are the Brigton Derry Billy Boys. #

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,278
You know, it's a pity.

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,560
I was looking forward to killing you.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,280
You're at the back of a long queue.

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,960
My white flag is a flag of truce.

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,598
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern,
the colour is the same.

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,038
The outcome is the same.

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,238
I believe we've friends in common.

31
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,798
We should postpone our war.

32
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,318
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,758
He sends his apologies.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,758
You left me land mines.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,678
For which I too apologise.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,838
Then peace it is.

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,558
Your message said you
wanted to seal our truce

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,678
with some business.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,318
Since we're men of similar
interests and distribution networks,

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,798
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,198
for our mutual benefit.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,998
You stand in a yard full of
scrap metal and stolen goods,

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,158
and you talk like a politician.

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,078
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,520
Charlie simply finds
things before they're lost.

46
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,838
The nature of the deal is
explained in my proposal.

47
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,438
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

48
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,038
If you need anything in this
city, just mention my name.

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,200
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
Isiah.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,758
Also in the envelope is a cheque for £500.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,598
For your wife. She can use
it to buy a black dress,

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,558
rent a black horse with black feathers,

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,678
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

55
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,600
should you break the
terms of the white flag.

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,960
Now, please, enjoy the city
it's my honour to represent.

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,718
This week, I've managed
to get to the people

58
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,798
at York and Lincoln City. I mean,
they're the teams that are losing.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,198
I got to them.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,358
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,118
Mm.

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,678
I got to the goalkeepers,
they all said £5 is enough.

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,640
I, erm...

64
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,038
I've written to the, er,
people at Tranmere Rovers

65
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,878
because the phone you put into
my...into my house stopped working.

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,998
-So I'm going to need another one of those.
-OK.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,318
Once we've got that fixed, hey,
then we'll have all the names

68
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,078
and numbers of the First Division referees.

69
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,638
-The First?
-Yeah.

70
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,518
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit.

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,478
Come on, come on, come on.

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,358
Listen, listen to me. Come on, now.

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,118
No need for that. Hm?

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,398
Yeah.

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,038
We need you to find out what they like.

76
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,120
You know, what gets them going.

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,678
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

78
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,038
We need you to find out what
they really like playing.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,358
Yes.

80
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,558
See, cos we can offer them that.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,278
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited,

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,078
we can offer them all the
lovely things people like.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,558
Hm?

84
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,880
We can also offer 'em protection
from the things they don't like.

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,640
You ever touch my family...

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,200
...ever...

87
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,118
York.

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Lincoln. Hm.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,878
Tranmere Rovers. Hm?

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,400
Mm-hm.

91
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,480
-Bye, Finn.
-Goodbye, brother.

92
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,480
Shit.

93
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,078
It's all right, Mrs
Connors. You can carry on.

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,760
It's just me brother.

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,158
So tell me how it happened?

96
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,078
They were sleeping downstairs.

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,878
And then my husband came home...

98
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,598
...drunk from the Marquis, even
though he just lost his job.

99
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,280
We don't have any money.

100
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,840
Anyway, he came to bed.

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,998
But downstairs, they
must have heard a noise.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,158
They woke up.

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,040
They started, er, calling out.

104
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
They woke my husband up, and...

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,320
...when he's drunk, you don't wake him up.

106
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,960
And what happened then, Mrs Connors?

107
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,158
He, erm...

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,998
He...

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
He went downstairs.

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,878
He killed them.

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,598
Strangled them. All three of them.

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,598
And you've, erm... You've...you've
brought their bodies

113
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,998
here today with you?

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
Proof, Mr Shelby.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Their singing was the only
pretty thing in my life.

116
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
I don't care my husband beats me...

117
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
...but not this.

118
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,278
Mrs Connors,

119
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,558
we have your address.

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,638
We will speak to your husband.

121
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,038
My brother here will go to
the Bull Ring market today,

122
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,598
and buy you three new goldfinches,

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,398
and have them delivered to your door.

124
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,518
The same colours and, you know, feathers.

125
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,480
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

126
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,598
That'll make him pause,

127
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
even when he's drunk.

128
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,840
Good day, Mr Shelby.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,518
You take care, Mrs Connors.

130
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
Bye.

131
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,958
I don't know how you do
this, Tom. I really don't!

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
You learn things, Arthur.

133
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,198
That woman has only two rooms downstairs.

134
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,678
Her husband has lost
his job and he beats her.

135
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,158
And yet, the thing that brings her

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,040
to see her Member of
Parliament is songbirds.

137
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,078
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

138
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,838
It's not for me.

139
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,118
Anyway, look.

140
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,678
That list of losers.

141
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,758
How much have we made on the football?

142
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,238
Ten grand this week.
Finn...showing promise, Tom.

143
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Maybe we should put him on
the tracks. Just a thought.

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,198
-Finn?
-Yeah?

145
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,640
-Your lunchtime delivery.
-Bring her in.

146
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,720
Tommy, the next fella
wants to see both of you.

147
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,080
-Do you know his face?
-No. He's Chinese.

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
Chinese in our pub?

149
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
Tom...

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
All right.

151
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Slowly, Micky, let him in.

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,680
Three little birds, eh,
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,160
Mr Thomas.

154
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,198
Mr Arthur.

155
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,000
My name is Brilliant Chang.

156
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,038
Brilliant Chang is dead.

157
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,760
Perhaps.

158
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,958
Sometimes I wonder,

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,198
"Is this heaven?"

160
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,678
Doesn't smell like heaven...

161
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,360
...so I would say I have survived.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,720
-What happened to Maggie?
-You don't like me?

163
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,080
I like everything.

164
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,480
I like fucking everything.

165
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,120
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

166
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,358
Micky, bring that phone here now.

167
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,358
Hello?

168
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Arthur! Arthur!

169
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,998
I sent a woman with a gun to
your youngest brother's office.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
-All right, Finn.
-Right, right.

171
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,440
What the fuck is going on?

172
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,960
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?

173
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,318
Good.

174
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,318
The guns are pointed.

175
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,878
Now we are all concentrating.

176
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,798
The moment is now pure.

177
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,158
Purity is not necessary.

178
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,878
Displays are not necessary.

179
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,080
They said, "Tommy Shelby.

180
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,400
"That door will need some kicking down."

181
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,000
When you walked through
that door, it was open.

182
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,958
You don't need to do
anything to get my attention.

183
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,838
Now, what exactly do you want?

184
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

185
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,198
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

186
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
...you die.

187
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,078
If you die here today, we'll
bury you face down with no hands.

188
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,758
-You'll go straight to hell.
-I don't care about rituals.

189
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,840
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,238
Well, tell your friend on the phone

191
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,360
to put her gun down, and
we can all have a talk.

192
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,918
Hold your fire, brother!

193
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Hold your fire!

194
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,078
I'm all right.

195
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,758
She fired into the ceiling.

196
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,758
Finn's all right.

197
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,080
Finn's OK.

198
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,398
Give me your order! Mm.

199
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,198
Give me your order, Tommy! Yes or no?

200
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,120
At ease.

201
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,920
I said, at ease.

202
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,080
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

203
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,398
That is the purest opium that
has ever arrived in Europe.

204
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,518
No salt, no flour, no lies.

205
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,560
Pure truth.

206
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,278
Came off a ship called the
Capital, out of Shanghai.

207
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,758
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

208
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,438
The stevedores were held at gunpoint.

209
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,920
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

210
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,238
A foreman at the dock estimated
there was seven tonnes of the stuff.

211
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,280
I made a note at the time.

212
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,238
I spoke to that particular foreman

213
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,758
and I worked out that

214
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,040
seven tonnes of pure opium
crystals would be worth...

215
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,598
...approximately, £1,190,000

216
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,238
on international markets.

217
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,000
The big crash. Hm?

218
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,198
Wall Street.

219
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,960
Now we all keep our ears
open for opportunities.

220
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,278
-What the fuck is going on?
-What are you playing at?

221
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,478
Finn, we are conducting
a piece of business.

222
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,400
She had a gun to my fucking head!

223
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,598
But your trousers are dry.

224
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,878
You didn't piss yourself.

225
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,038
-He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
-Well done, Finn.

226
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,598
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

227
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,118
And Arthur here tells me we
should put you on the tracks.

228
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,878
-Going to be a good day for you after all, Finn.
-Give me that!

229
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,558
Hey!

230
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,118
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

231
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,358
If I see that bitch on the
street, I'll fucking cut her.

232
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,718
Yeah, all right. All right, come on.

233
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

234
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,400
A gesture of goodwill.

235
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll throw it in the canal.

236
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,920
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

237
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,118
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

238
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,198
What fucking deal?

239
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,158
How does it feel to be
barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

240
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,918
It makes me feel young. What fucking deal?

241
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,158
Four boats. Four days.

242
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,678
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

243
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,438
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

244
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,918
pure opium crystal.

245
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,118
Opium?

246
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,478
I vote against it.

247
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,158
They can't use trucks
because the Chinese drivers

248
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,758
get stopped by the police.

249
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,558
They need to get it out of London because all
the warehouses are being searched by Customs.

250
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,998
The seven tonnes is
bound for San Francisco,

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,078
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days, from Liverpool.

252
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,238
They need somewhere safe to store it.

253
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,078
All we have to do is take it up the
canal and keep it here for a week.

254
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,438
We don't fuck with the Chinese,
though, Tom. Dad always said it.

255
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,278
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

256
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,638
to drive four boats up the canal

257
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,600
with no prospect of inspection?

258
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,878
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

259
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,478
-Mmm.
-Polly?

260
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,118
£250,000.

261
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,838
That's half of what
Michael lost in Chicago.

262
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,998
I will ask him to take
charge of this business.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,238
Michael's position will be
reinstated in the company?

264
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,520
His period of quarantine would be over.

265
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,438
Think about it, brother.

266
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,958
Four boats sailing up the cut,

267
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

268
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,718
And which one of Charlie's
Gypsy didicoy friends

269
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,358
do you trust, Tom, eh, with
a cargo worth £1 million?

270
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,718
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

271
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's vote.

272
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,840
Those in favour.

273
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,718
Motion carried. Arthur, tell
Charlie we need four boats

274
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,478
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

275
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,960
They sail south tonight.

276
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,678
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring

277
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,038
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

278
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,240
Yes, Tommy.

279
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
Fuck!

280
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,480
What have you heard, Pol?

281
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,200
The man you cut went to the police...

282
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,440
...but we dealt with it.

283
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,840
Is she with him?

284
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,598
If she was, it would be your fault, Arthur.

285
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,398
But they say his face is so
badly cut he's hard to look at.

286
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
So I would say not.

287
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,238
I would also say it is
time to give up on Linda,

288
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,360
find someone else...

289
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
..who might be able to put your fires out.

290
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,760
I can't, though, Pol.

291
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,080
I fucking can't!

292
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,240
And that's it.

293
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,080
That's it.

294
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,798
Whisky?

295
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,080
Thank you, no.

296
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,958
For reasons I can't divulge, I
need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

297
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,198
But I've already got a time
and a place for the killing.

298
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,558
You see?

299
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,078
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

300
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,438
A girl called Karen, who hates
him, who will give him up.

301
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,318
I have the sound of cranes and
winches to cover the gunshot.

302
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,798
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

303
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,998
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

304
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,598
We've made peace. We're
going to do business together.

305
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,358
When that business is done, he's all yours.

306
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,038
You can avenge the death of
your son in any way you see fit.

307
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,078
You mean when YOU say.

308
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,198
When you check that
little stopwatch you've got

309
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
that controls the turning of the Earth.

310
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,438
Yeah.

311
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,478
And then you will marry,
and you will settle.

312
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,760
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

313
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,478
Just let me understand you.

314
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,600
Do you mean that Polly
is part of this deal?

315
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,640
Yeah.

316
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,238
Well, Holy Lord God, Tommy Shelby OBE,

317
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,678
does your vanity have no limits?

318
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,958
I believe it is called
"the ego" these days.

319
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,918
-I read books.
-You sit on your throne and you instruct Polly Gray,

320
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,638
who is of far richer blood than you,

321
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,558
as to when she can and
when she can't marry.

322
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,958
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

323
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,118
She has her own strategies.

324
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,918
And we are of the same blood.

325
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,398
She will marry you, but only if you agree

326
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,758
to postpone any attack on McCavern

327
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,558
until this business is done.

328
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,998
So she is some young Gypsy
bride that's yours to give away.

329
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,798
Young she is, when she's
barefoot on the cobbles.

330
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,998
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's going to be done in the old way,

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,398
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

332
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,598
I'm having an event at me house.

333
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,238
You are invited.

334
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,198
Polly will be there.

335
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,878
There will be candles
and violins and dancing.

336
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,038
Polly wants you to
propose in the proper way,

337
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,358
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

338
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,480
Inviting you for this
purpose was Polly's idea.

339
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,278
-You can't read?
-I don't read.

340
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,398
-It's Swan Lake.
-Ballet? -Yeah.

341
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,718
Apparently, it's about love.

342
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,118
Polly says that, for now,

343
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
love must defeat revenge.

344
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,278
...As a result of the greed and the excess

345
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,318
of a small number of bankers, financiers

346
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,598
and other feckless gamblers.

347
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,478
This comprehensive document,

348
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,358
pleading for Government intervention
in all areas of economic life,

349
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,558
represents not just socialism,

350
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,518
but a new breed
- of National Socialism.

351
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,998
And I believe... I believe
that the leaders of my own party

352
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,958
have been very foolish to reject it.

353
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,918
How on Earth did you get a ballet company

354
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,878
to come to your bloody house?

355
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,998
It's an independent dance company

356
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,318
dedicated to bringing ballet to the people.

357
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,158
We share a philosophy.

358
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,438
I'm a patron.

359
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,600
I also gave them a lot of money.

360
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
Oh.

361
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,798
And this date

362
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,680
is your wife's birthday.

363
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,558
Yeah.

364
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,640
The party is for her.

365
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,280
And she likes ballet, your wife?

366
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,038
Why wouldn't she?

367
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,558
It's just...

368
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,720
Well, you see, I did
some research into her.

369
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,558
Into her past.

370
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,680
If you want to buy her a
gift, she likes diamonds.

371
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,558
Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

372
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,878
we need to have no secrets.

373
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,320
We should know each other's weaknesses.

374
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,080
Your wife has led an interesting life.

375
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,078
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

376
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I came across her.

377
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,600
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

378
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,158
Well, if you recognise her,

379
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,360
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

380
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,478
Maybe, if we have met before,

381
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,720
your wife and I could even
renew our acquaintance.

382
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,960
I am invited to stay the night, yes?

383
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,400
I too have done some research, Sir Oswald.

384
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,278
Yeah.

385
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,638
I researched your wife and
your wife's younger sister,

386
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,878
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon,

387
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,558
all of whom you are fucking.

388
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,998
If such things were to
take place on a narrow boat,

389
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
the Church would get involved.

390
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,438
But...

391
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,680
...it's not happening on a narrow boat.

392
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,478
No. It's taking place in your
apartment, in your country house,

393
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,358
sometimes even in your office

394
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,840
here in the House of Commons.

395
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,358
So no secrets. And, yes,

396
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,598
yes, you are invited to stay the night

397
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,238
with whichever member of
your family finds favour.

398
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,678
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

399
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,520
I need to lock up me office.

400
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,800
Actually, I will come alone.

401
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,278
In society, you are
judged by your hospitality.

402
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
I will expect adventure.

403
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,918
Such rogues we are, aren't we?

404
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,598
Sing like songbirds in the House.

405
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,398
And then, afterwards,

406
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,360
relieve ourselves in the
bodies of whomever we choose.

407
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,640
Two men for whom forbidding is forbidden.

408
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,760
It should be quite the party.

409
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,238
You have to listen to
the voices that you hear.

410
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,958
Do what they tell you to do.

411
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,840
You don't even have to rub the
lamp any more to summon the genie.

412
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.

413
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,800
It was you.

414
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,040
It was you.

415
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,638
Who is it?

416
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,398
It's Tommy's car outside.

417
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,160
It's him. I'll get it.

418
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,558
What's happened?

419
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,878
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.

420
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,160
Come in.

421
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,558
Do you want a drink?

422
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,718
-No.
-No?

423
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,400
No. I have some information
for the intelligence officer...

424
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,038
...on conversations with Mosley.

425
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,598
He's planning to put forward
proposals on building works.

426
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,758
He, erm...

427
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,838
He wants the Communists to
consider his new party as fraternal,

428
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,438
which means his activities are now
part of your official remit? Yeah?

429
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,398
Mr Shelby, it's 2am. You can
make your report any time.

430
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,000
-Why don't you stay tonight?
-No.

431
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,878
I'll leave you two to...

432
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,598
Yes, goodnight.

433
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,038
I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.

434
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,360
And I looked down.

435
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,960
And Grace was there...

436
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,798
...but she was still alive.

437
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,758
Tom, have you still been taking laudanum?

438
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
The fucking name of the
barge was The January.

439
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,798
Our dad's boat.

440
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,558
The boat I was born on.
We've never got nothing.

441
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,880
We've never got nothing.
And we never fucking will.

442
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,718
Dr Brooke said that you never
arrived for your appointment, Tom.

443
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,278
No.

444
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,078
There's nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

445
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,478
They talk about guilt.

446
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,958
Eh?

447
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,998
Guilt! What fucking guilt?

448
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,798
-The black barge.
-No. No, that's not it.

449
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,798
That's not it. He had it right.

450
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:40,038
Mosley had it right. He said,
"Forbidding is forbidden to us.

451
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,958
"We can do anything. Nothing can stop us."

452
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,640
But there's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself.

453
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,080
And I keep finding myself there.

454
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,160
And only The January can get me away.

455
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

456
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,718
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

457
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,358
It's that that causes the visions.

458
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,118
Just...throw it away.

459
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,038
While it's there, it's a temptation.

460
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,520
How much have you got left?

461
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,158
Seven tonnes.

462
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,440
-Seven tonnes?
-Yeah.

463
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,600
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

464
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
You do me a favour?

465
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,518
When that kid of yours arrives,

466
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,080
keep it away from me.

467
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,998
A fucking ballet.

468
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,838
He wants to impress someone.

469
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,598
And I'm invited?

470
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,840
You and Gina.

471
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,438
Why?

472
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,760
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

473
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,998
-Coal haulage?
-Yeah.

474
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,080
Tommy wants you to reopen those
books and become managing director.

475
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,640
So I've come back from
Detroit to become a coalman?

476
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,278
The first delivery is
bound for San Francisco,

477
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,238
but if it works...

478
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,960
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

479
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,200
And this, erm, this coal...

480
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,280
-...is it snow white?
-No.

481
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,920
Golden brown.

482
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
Fuck.

483
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,158
This is your opportunity, Michael.

484
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,598
There is more money in this than there is

485
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,720
in all the other parts of
our business put together.

486
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,278
Tommy knows what opium does to people.

487
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,878
Tommy knows what whisky does to people.

488
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,000
He got an OBE for selling it.

489
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,080
I'll speak to Gina.

490
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,038
You'll what?

491
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,960
I will consult my wife.

492
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,958
Your father ran this business for a bit.

493
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,878
1901.

494
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,758
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

495
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,518
Just coal.

496
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,878
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

497
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,598
And the merchants would
offer them one price

498
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,558
and then only pay half,

499
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,478
because they could.

500
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,160
And that was wrong, Michael.

501
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,320
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

502
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,440
...and then see if Gina will
let you lay a finger on her.

503
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,400
I think golden brown is more to her taste.

504
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,760
Especially when you tell her how
much money you're going to earn.

505
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,078
Now we're in business
together, I should ask,

506
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,318
which foot do you kick
the ball with, Mr Shelby?

507
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,718
I have no religion.

508
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,280
Some nights, I wish I had.

509
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,638
He's kin?

510
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,118
Yeah.

511
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,678
And the simple fellow?

512
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,200
He's a lot less simple than
you might at first think.

513
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,120
Do you trust them?

514
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,318
Right. So I take a boatload.

515
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,718
No.

516
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,558
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

517
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,758
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

518
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,438
Cash payment on loading.

519
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,118
£10,000.

520
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,558
For that amount, it'll have to be a cheque.

521
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,160
I don't take cheques.

522
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,760
It'll be a cheque.

523
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,638
I will take a cheque

524
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,998
if it's guaranteed by our
mutual friend in London,

525
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,760
Mr Mosley.

526
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,518
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

527
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,440
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

528
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,118
Yeah, who'd have thought, eh, Charlie?

529
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,318
Who would have thought it?

530
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,158
Aye, but you're OK.

531
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,558
Yeah, I'm only OK until I'm not OK.

532
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,680
Then I'm really not.

533
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,520
Delivery in seven days.

534
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,278
Cheque guaranteed.

535
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,518
Won't your Chinese friends expect
the seven tonnes that leaves London

536
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,678
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

537
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,118
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

538
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,958
Oh, you mean you're bold
enough to skim the Chinese?

539
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,160
You have some kind of
death wish, Mr Shelby?

540
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,160
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

541
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,760
When you've unpacked, there
should be a girl laid on for you.

542
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,958
Mr Shelby is a socialist,

543
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,640
and believes in equality
of service for all classes.

544
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,878
According to the invitation,

545
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,358
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

546
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,720
Say that you're feeling
tired, and we'll leave.

547
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,838
Well, if you see a duke, introduce me.

548
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,958
My God, at last!

549
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,920
Something you like about England.

550
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,760
Gina, I've been made an offer.

551
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,678
To come back into the company.

552
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,078
Michael, we agreed,

553
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,038
the baby will be born
in New York. Remember?

554
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,280
The job is haulage.

555
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
Supply. Transport.

556
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Opium.

557
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,840
-Tommy has made contact...
-Tommy!

558
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,958
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

559
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,080
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

560
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,120
Pure grade.

561
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,240
We will take delivery and
ship it all over Europe.

562
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,720
You mean heroin?

563
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,920
Yes.

564
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,998
And how much would you make?

565
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,958
Conservative estimate, three
shipments a year from Shanghai,

566
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,758
seven tonnes each,

567
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,518
stand to make approximately £1 million.

568
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,318
Per annum.

569
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,960
The company will make three.

570
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,518
We could go to New York whenever we wanted.

571
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,600
On our own fucking plane.

572
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,678
-We always have to come back, right?
-Yes.

573
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
For £1 million a year, we do.

574
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,358
What happens if you get caught?

575
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,278
Tommy has friends.

576
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,440
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

577
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,880
Think about it, Gina.

578
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,400
When we move into our house...

579
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,400
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

580
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,280
Will it, now?

581
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,958
The magazines say that

582
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,200
it's all straight lines
and simplicity in the 1930s.

583
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
Deco is dead.

584
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,200
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

585
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,878
And maybe...

586
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,840
...maybe a princess or two.

587
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,960
And the painting on
the wall will be of you.

588
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,758
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone,

589
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,240
and it will be Michael
Gray arranging the ballet.

590
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Where will Tommy be?

591
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,120
Where he wants to go to most.

592
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000
Ah.

593
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,678
There.

594
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,958
A lord.

595
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,040
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

596
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,640
Where the fuck is Tommy, anyway?

597
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,198
Tommy...

598
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,678
My house.

599
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,078
My wife.

600
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,680
We'll let 'em wait.

601
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,040
Sir Oswald.

602
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,358
Do I not get announced?

603
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,918
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

604
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,198
that he's busy with the
catering preparations

605
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,080
and will be joining you shortly.

606
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,638
In the meantime, and while you're waiting,

607
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,320
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

608
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,558
I don't use opium or cocaine,

609
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,240
and brandy is for after dinner, not before.

610
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,558
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

611
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,080
You'll notice that the
maids wear name tags.

612
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,040
We hired them specially...

613
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,158
...for those guests staying the night.

614
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,678
All things are available...

615
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,800
..except the ballerinas.

616
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,080
And who, might I ask, are you?

617
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,720
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

618
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,480
And I too am unavailable.

619
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,638
Lizzie.

620
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,878
There's something I didn't
tell you about this evening.

621
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,958
Something about our guest.

622
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,320
Mosley.

623
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,798
It's possible that...

624
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,798
...that you've met him before.

625
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,440
Before when?

626
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,480
Before you became who you are.

627
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,958
Would you even remember him?

628
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,680
Would he remember you?

629
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,678
All I remember is, I
drank too much champagne.

630
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,360
And I wasn't taking cash.

631
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,480
Lizzie...

632
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,278
There's a pile of bodies...

633
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,558
...floating by.

634
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,558
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

635
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Let 'em go.

636
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,838
So that's why you brought me in here.

637
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,560
To lay your claim.

638
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,680
Yeah.

639
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,400
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

640
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,718
He lays a fucking hand on you,

641
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,880
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

642
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,880
You were indisposed when I arrived.

643
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,518
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

644
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,798
...looking around like a fucking dog.

645
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,158
Before we join the others, I have
some business. I need a signature.

646
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,958
By the way, your brandy
before dinner thing amuses me,

647
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,718
but none of the maids are of interest.

648
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,920
And I despise the use of drugs.

649
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,000
Your strategies are very transparent.

650
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,598
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

651
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,078
your acquaintance from the north.

652
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,118
I have no idea who you mean.

653
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,998
I don't trust him. He
wants to pay by cheque.

654
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,758
I need your signature as a
guarantor on the transaction,

655
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,958
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

656
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,478
The sum is £10,000.

657
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,278
And what is it he's buying from you?

658
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,718
A gin distillery.

659
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,558
He's buying me old one.
I'm buying a new one.

660
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,000
Hmm.

661
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,958
So not only is the truce holding,

662
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,558
but you two are actually doing business.

663
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,200
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

664
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,198
If I sign a cheque guarantee for this man,

665
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,958
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

666
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,240
Something you could later use against me.

667
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,640
Why would I want to move against you?

668
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,360
You're curious about my weaknesses.

669
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,678
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

670
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,440
not maids.

671
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,358
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

672
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,080
Do you have a pen?

673
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,318
Mr Shelby.

674
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,838
I know you had no classical education,

675
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,518
but I just realised you are the
perfect balance between the gods

676
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,598
Dionysus and Apollo.

677
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,360
Irrational frenzy controlled
by reason and self-reflection.

678
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,838
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

679
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,798
-No.
-Freud?

680
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,040
-Yes.
-Ah.

681
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,878
There.

682
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,800
Your guarantee of trust.

683
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,320
Now, perhaps you could introduce
me to your wonderful wife.

684
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,198
So, did you know?

685
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,998
What?

686
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,358
Oh, that tonight's special
guest might have fucked you

687
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,278
when you were a nightclub hostess?

688
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,600
Yeah.

689
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,158
Lizzie, if we were to
strike from our guest lists

690
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,640
every man in Birmingham who you...

691
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,278
-Yes or no?
-Fucking yes.

692
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,680
Shit.

693
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,798
Sir Oswald, this is my wife, Elizabeth.

694
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,720
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

695
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,358
Since we all appear to know,

696
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,878
and since knowledge is permission,

697
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,358
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the
spirit of our honest relationship,

698
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,158
you won't mind me saying

699
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,920
it was a bottle of champagne
and an evening well spent.

700
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,800
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

701
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,118
For the champagne and brandy you bought me!

702
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,598
As I recall, it was the
booze that put you to sleep

703
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,798
a little prematurely.

704
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the
dance is about to begin.

705
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,918
Mr Mosley!

706
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,838
A toast, if I may.

707
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,358
To the end of our deal,

708
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,758
and the beginning of something more.

709
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,880
Happy birthday, Lizzie.

710
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,560
This way.

711
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,078
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

712
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,638
will you marry me,

713
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,440
a poor commoner who loves you?

714
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,520
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

715
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,480
I heard there was a family occasion.

716
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,878
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

717
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,078
That animal inside me,

718
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,680
it comes out and I can't stop it.

719
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,438
Fuck, Linda.

720
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,278
Without you, I c...

721
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,320
Come inside, please.

722
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,438
His name was Frederick.

723
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,798
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

724
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,400
He just listened.

725
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,640
And now he has no face.

726
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,160
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

727
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,000
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

728
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,640
...in fucking hell.

729
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,880
Arthur...
