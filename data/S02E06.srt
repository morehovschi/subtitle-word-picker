﻿1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,250
The pro-treaty paddies and the king
want the same man dead.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,650
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,810
The Epsom Derby, Pol. We'll be
drinking with the bloody king.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,930
For the last ten years,
Sabini's made it his race.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,450
If we're going to take him down,
might as well make it there.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,130
~ It's good to see you, Grace.
~ Tommy, do you have someone?

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,490
Your horse will come fifth or sixth.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,570
But I will win you.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,290
Mr Churchill was impressed.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,170
He has asked that the
Colonial Office grant him

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,490
an Empire export licence.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,170
I want my son out of prison. Now.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,130
He can be freed by tomorrow morning.

14
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,410
I'm talking about a simple
transaction here.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,810
I will carry out the assassination
at a place of my choosing...

16
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,050
Epsom.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,140
Derby Day.

of your export business.

132

133
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,170
No, no, no, no.

134
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,980
See, I had my lawyer draw this
up for us, just in case.

135
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,250
It says that...

136
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,500
here, that 100%
of your business...

137

138

~ I see. ~ Just there...

139
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,210
Don't worry about it, right.
Cos it is totally legal, binding.

140
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,210
All you have to do is
sign the document

141
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,250
and transfer the whole
lot over to me.

142
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,930
Sign just here, is it?

143
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,170
Yeah.

144
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,860
I see. That's funny, that is.

145
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,940
~ What? ~ No, that's funny.

146
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,620
I'll give you 100% of my business?

147
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,340
Yeah!

148
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,380
Why?

149
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,770
Ollie, no.

150
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,690
No. No. Ollie, no. Put that down.

151
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,690
He understands. He understands.

152
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,850
He's a big boy, he knows the road.

153
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,170
Now, look, it's just
non-fucking-negotiable.

154
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,410
That is all you need to know,

155
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,730
so all you have to do is sign
the fucking contract.

156
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,370
~ Right there. ~ Just sign here.

157
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,050
~ With your pen. ~ I understand.

158
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,810
Good. Get on with it.

159
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,020
I have an associate waiting
for me at the door.

160
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,370
I know, he looks like a choirboy

161
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,090
but he is actually an anarchist

162
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,090
~ from Kentish Town. ~ Tommy,

163
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,970
I am going to fucking
shoot you. Right?

164
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,450
Now, when I came in here,
Mr Solomons,

165
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,010
I stopped to tie my shoelace...

166
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,370
Isn't that a fact, Ollie?

167
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,650
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

168
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,490
And while I was doing it,

169
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,410
I laid a hand grenade under
one of your barrels.

170
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,290
A mark 15 with wire trip.

171
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,730
My friend upstairs is like one of
those anarchists

172
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,170
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

173
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,260
He's a professional.
And he's in charge of the wire.

174
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,530
If I don't walk out of that
door by the stroke of seven,

175
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,650
he's going to trigger the grenade

176
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,890
and your very combustible rum

177
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,740
will blow us all to hell.

178
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,420
And I don't care...

179
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,540
.. cos I am already dead.

180
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,090
He tied his lace, Alfie.
And there is a kid at the door.

181
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,970
From a good family, too. Ollie,
it is shocking what they become.

182
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,570
What were you doing
when this happened?

183
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,130
He tied his lace. Nothing else.

184
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,970
Yeah. But what were you doing?

185
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,740
Marking the runners in the paper.

186
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,530
What are you doing?

187
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,700
Just checking the time. Carry on.

188
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,770
Ollie, I want you to go outside

189
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,810
and shoot that boy in the face
from the good family.

190
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,500
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

191
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,260
~ He tied his fucking lace, Alfie.
~ I did tie my lace.

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,820
I bet hundred to one...

193
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,210
.. that you're fucking lying, mate.

194
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:19,410
~ That's my money. ~ Well, you see, you
have failed to consider the form.

195
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,660
I did blow up my own pub
for the insurance.

196
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,930
OK, right, well,
considering the form,

197
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,850
I would say, 65 to one.

198
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,530
Very good odds. And I would be
more than happy and agree

199
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,610
for you to sign over 65%
of your business to me.

200
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,250
~ Thank you. ~ 65? No deal.
Ollie, what do you say?

201
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,810
Jesus Christ, Alfie,
He tied his fucking lace. I saw him.

202
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,330
Look, he planted a grenade.
I know he did.

203
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,260
Alfie, it is Tommy fucking Shelby.

204
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,250
You are behaving
like a fucking child.

205
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,820
This is a man's world.

206
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,780
Now, get that apron off and sit
in the corner like a little boy.

207
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,980
Fuck off. Now!

208
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,890
~ Four minutes.
~ Right, four minutes.

209
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,650
Talk to me about hand grenades.

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,050
The chalk mark on the barrel at knee
height said, "Hamilton Christmas".

211
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,260
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

212
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,180
Based on this...

213
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,250
.. 45%.

214
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,810
30.

215
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,340
Aw, fuck off, Tommy.
That's far too little.

216
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,380
In France, Mr Solomons, when I was
a tunneller. A clay kicker. A 179.

217
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,060
I blew up Schwaben Hohe.

218
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,780
Same kit I'm using today.

219
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,980
Funny that.

220
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,810
I do know the 179

221
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,690
and I heard they all got buried.

222
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,570
Three of us dug ourselves out.

223
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,860
Like you're digging
yourself out now.

224
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,700
Like I'm digging now.

225
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,980
(Fuck me!)

226
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,500
Listen, I'll give you 35%.
That's your lot.

227
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,380
35.

228
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,420
~ You're late. ~ I had business.

229
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,890
How the fuck did you get me
out of that?

230
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,850
I need you today, brother.

231
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,140
~ And pulled some strings.
You all right? ~ I am now.

232
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,170
So, Arthur's back in charge now?

233
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,170
He's in charge of you and you're
both in charge of him.

234
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,330
~ Look-out duties only today.
~ Tommy, I'm getting sick of this...

235
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,900
Finn, you don't obey orders,
you don't come.

236
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,170
~ Johnny Dogs. ~ Tommy?

237
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,220
~ Your boys will meet us there?
~ The Lees will be there, Captain.

238
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,690
"Captain"?

239
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,050
Aye, we promoted you.

240
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,930
Well, the boys decided you're no
longer like a Sergeant Major.

241
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,490
Fucking those rich women
and using those fancy words.

242
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,530
I'd say you're more
like a captain these days.

243
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,820
Fine, well, I'll take
it as a compliment.

244
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,410
Just don't bloody shoot me.
Let's go to the Derby, boys.

245
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,660
Right then, load them up.

246
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,090
Hello?

247
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,300
No, I'm afraid Mr Shelby
is in London.

248
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,540
He can't be reached.
No, he won't be back today.

249
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,300
He's at the races.
The Epsom races. The Epsom Derby.

250
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,740
Can I ask who's calling?

251
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,260
I'm going to the station.

252
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,300
~ What's that? ~ That money's yours.

253
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,970
You take the money,

254
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,130
you get a train
and you start a new life

255
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,380
in London. I don't want to see
you here when I get back.

256
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,540
If I get back.

257
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,020
Everything's an "if"
in this Birmingham life.

258
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,770
You can write on Sundays.

259
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,250
And visit on Holy Days.

260
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,780
But I want you to wash this city
out your hair and your clothes.

261
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,810
It is what I should have
done at the start.

262
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,500
Now, I've got business to attend to.

263
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,740
I do love you, Michael.

264
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,020
I love you, too.

265
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,540
You'll miss your train.

266
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,140
My beloved greyhounds...

267
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,460
.. behold today's rabbit.

268
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,820
When I give you the signal, I want
you to send that man to his maker.

269
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,930
I decided to use you men,

270
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,490
because I couldn't trust the hearts
and the livers

271
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,220
of the English pansies and posies
they've given me as operatives.

272
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,060
Now...

273
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,140
.. this is a man of some
capability...

274
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,610
.. but I expect no excuses
and no failures.

275
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,330
The Red Right Hand of the
Ulster Volunteer Force

276
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,300
will not let you down, Mr Campbell.

277
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,740
The Red Right Hand.

278
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,090
Good luck, gentlemen.

279
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,050
♪ They're whispering his name

280
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,690
♪ Through this disappearing land

281
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,450
♪ But hidden in his coat

282
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,860
♪ Is a red right hand. ♪

283
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,370
Gentlemen, today we are not
fucking about.

284
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,170
I hope you've all obeyed instructions
and brought loaded firearms with you.

285
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,890
~ Yes.
~ Very good.

286
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,810
You all know that if you are lifted
on a race track these days

287
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,970
with a loaded weapon,
you get 20 years.

288
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,650
That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

289
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,090
Because today, there'll be no
coppers around to lift you.

290
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,530
At exactly three o'clock,

291
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,370
there will be an incident
in the owner's enclosure.

292
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,650
And all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

293
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,250
They'll be looking for someone.

294
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,810
~ So, you'll be free to operate at
will. ~ Looking for who?

295
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,810
Me. They'll be looking for me.

296
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,650
Now, while the coppers
are busy with me,

297
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,650
you will make your move on
Sabini's pitches.

298
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,050
You confiscate his takings,
you destroy his licences

299
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,170
and you do it at gunpoint.

300
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,250
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

301
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,050
We should aim to complete the take
over without a shot being fired.

302
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,250
Understood?

303
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,410
And remember, the licences are more
important than the takings.

304
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,250
All right. Before the fun begins, you
can all lay ten bob on Nom De Guerre.

305
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,170
I hear she's going to win.

306
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,930
Only beer beforehand, boys.

307
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,330
There'll be plenty of time
for rum and whisky after.

308
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,770
And remember, do not make a move
until three, when the coppers leave.

309
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,930
~ That is all. ~ Feeling lucky, John.

310
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,250
Incidents...
What are you going to do

311
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,730
that's going to make every copper
at the Derby look the other way?

312
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,450
Trust me, brother!

313
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,300
Over here. Over here.
Are you ready, boys?

314
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,020
Ten, please.

315
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,500
It's right here, mate.

316
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,660
She threw a shoe coming
out of the box.

317
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,050
She looks in fine shape.

318
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,970
Hello, hello, hello.

319
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,700
~ Should I be worried?
~ You should not.

320
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,370
Go and drink. Enjoy the day.

321
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,260
I'll come and find you
when the race is done.

322
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,650
That's nice, is that yours?

323
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,810
My mother wore it to
the Derby in 1895.

324
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,730
She was presented to Queen Victoria.

325
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,970
After the race,

326
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,210
I'll change in the horse box

327
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,690
and then come and join you up there
with the toffs. What do you say?

328
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,580
Hm... yeah.

329
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,900
You don't want me to join you.

330
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,540
It's fine. I'll stay
down here in the mud.

331
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,410
Whatever happens today,

332
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,740
it was good.

333
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,940
You mean win or lose?

334
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,620
Yeah. Win or lose.

335
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,610
You know I never watch the race.
I can't stand it.

336
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,460
I always like to find
somewhere dark and quiet...

337
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,340
Tommy?

338
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,890
If you can't find me up there,

339
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,820
I'll come and find you later.

340
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,170
What do you mean?

341
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,970
Whatever happens, May, no regrets.

342
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,460
No regrets.

343
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,260
And I will find you.

344
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,370
Right.

345
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,050
Remember that.

346
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,140
Bye.

Come on. Let's go.

357
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,330
I have to talk to you....

358
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,610
~ Grace. What are you doing here?
~ I have to talk to you.

359
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Grace... this is not a good time.

360
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,660
This way. Excuse us.

361
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,170
Whatever it is, Grace,
it'll have to wait.

362
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,780
It can't wait.
It wasn't me who was at fault.

363
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm pregnant.

364
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,380
The baby's yours.

365
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,770
But he'll believe... Make your
husband believe that it's his.

366
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,410
Is that what you want me to do?

367
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,210
Grace, I seriously have things to do.

368
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,970
~ It's not even worth the toss
of a coin this time. ~ Grace.

369
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,570
I have things to do. When they are...

370
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,730
When they are done, I will decide.

371
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,570
~ And when will that be?
~ After the race.

372
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,330
After the race?
After the fucking race, Tommy?

373
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,610
When the race is over,
I will decide what to do.

374
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,140
~ What to fucking do. All right?
~ But, Tommy...

375
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,530
I was right not to tell him.

376
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,530
I could have phoned him
and lied, but I didn't.

377
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,170
Just tell me I was right
not to phone and lie.

378
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,100
Agree with that, Tommy.

379
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,010
Yes. Yes, Grace.

380
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,460
Because the thing is...

381
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,900
.. I love you, not him.

382
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,660
That is a thing.

383
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,180
~ A baby, Thomas. ~ Yes.

384
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,930
Go to your race.

385
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,300
~ Where will you be? ~ I'll be waiting.

386
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,900
I'll wait where they lay their bets.

387
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,570
Found a lost sheep.

388
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,660
Come on, Lizzie.

389
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,250
~ What do you think? ~ About what?

390
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,580
~ About the dress?
~ Undo two buttons. Come on!

391
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,980
~ Oh, Tommy, I never thought
I'd see the like of this. ~ Yeah.

392
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,010
But I do know that I'm here to work.

393
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,610
~ So you may have noticed
I haven't taken a drink. ~ Here.

394
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,140
Take this. You might need it.

395
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,370
What's the work you want me
to do here today, Tommy?

396
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,210
Taking notes on a meeting?

397
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,210
No, Lizzie. You're not
here to take notes.

398
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,060
My shorthand won't be required.

399
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,700
Lizzie...

400
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,970
.. there's a man here.

401
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,330
And I need him to be separated from
the crowd and taken to a quiet place.

402
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,010
"A quiet place"?

403
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,220
~ Lizzie, I know what I said.
~ Yeah, you know.

404
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,010
You know you told me I shouldn't
do that kind of work any more.

405
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,330
I just need you to
isolate him is all.

406
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,490
No exceptions, you said.

407
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,140
I have drawn a map, all right?

408
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,650
Of where exactly
you need to take him.

409
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,410
For months, I made no exceptions,

410
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,290
~ Because you told me not to.
~ Lizzie...

411
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,490
just keep him busy at the
place marked with an X

412
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:31,100
and I'll get to you before
he can start, I promise. All right?

413
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,170
Mustn't smudge my eyes.
He might not like that.

414
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,370
Lizzie, this is the only time.

415
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,250
And after this, never again.

416
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,290
All right, I'll pay you
an extra five...

417
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,170
DO NOT talk to me about money now.

418
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,820
Not right now or I swear
I'll break this glass in your eyes.

419
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,330
"No exceptions"
has been no hardship.

420
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,500
You know why?

421
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,300
Hmm?

422
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,460
Doesn't matter.

423
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,850
~ Who is he? ~ To your right.

424
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,940
Soldier.

425
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,130
Smoking a cigarette.

426
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,970
Just be alone with him at three
when the race starts.

427
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,570
I'll do the rest. Yeah?

428
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,930
~ Got a piece of chalk? ~ Chalk?

429
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,130
It's how the soldiers know.
It doesn't matter.

430
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,020
Just give me the fucking chalk!

431
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,730
Lizzie, it is going
to be all right, eh?

432
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,170
I'll get to you, I promise,
before it can start.

433
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,260
I will be there.

434
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,890
Keep them fucking guns ready.

435
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,260
~ Keep them guns ready.
~ He's here, boss.

436
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,220
The coppers aren't moving. They're
stood there like fucking gargoyles.

437
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,540
Keep your wits about you, boys,
all right?!

438
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,410
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the race will begin in four minutes.

439
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,660
'Please make your way track side...'

440
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,940
Shouldn't you be busy?

441
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,580
When you plan something well
there's no need to rush.

442
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,140
You know something?
I actually trust you to do this.

443
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,970
Do you think there might
be some measure of respect

444
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,370
developing between us?

445
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,130
'Ladies and gentlemen,
the runners and riders

446
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,250
'are coming to order.
Please take your seats...'

447
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,220
Old foes who have grown
to admire each other?

448
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,060
And see each other's
professional virtues.

449
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,650
Personally... I think not.

450
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,180
I think not.

451
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,420
Well, I'll drink to that.

452
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,810
'Ladies and gentlemen, please be
upstanding for the national anthem.'

453
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,610
So, is the plan that you'll stay
together for ever?

454
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,170
Or perhaps she'll whore for you
and take her husband's money.

455
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,820
Is that the plan?

456
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,140
How wrong I was about her?

457
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,260
I was wrong about her, as well.

458
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,140
You once said to me,
that men like us can never be loved.

459
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,220
But she loves me. She told me.

460
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,460
She loves me.

461
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,460
And all you got was a bullet
and a fucking wolf head cane.

462
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,500
Well, bully for you.

463
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,180
This I know...

464
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,010
Ahead of you is damnation.

465
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,930
But I have the love of God
and the certainty of salvation.

466
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,420
I know what you did to Polly.

467
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,180
I know what happened
to Michael in jail.

468
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,810
Today, it will be me dead or you.

469
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,340
But whoever it is,
they'll wake up in hell tomorrow.

470
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,130

472
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,340
'And they're off!'

473
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,140
Come on, girl. Come on.

474
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,220
At least make a showing.

475
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,100
Come on, Tommy.

476
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,980
What a pretty dress.

477
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,010
Take it off.

478
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,170
Shall we take this off first,
shall we?

479
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:24,100
~ Lift up your dress and show me
that you're clean. ~ Oh!

480
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,100
Do as you're told!

481
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:33,260
We should take it slow.
We've got all the time.

482
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,810
This area is closed off.

483
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,130
~ What? ~ The king will be coming this
way after the race.

484
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,940
This area is secured.
You'll have to go round.

485
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,730
Get the fuck off! Fuck off.

486
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,900
Get the fuck off me!

487
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,100
Oi!

488
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,690
RUSSELL!

489
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,020
Fuck!

490
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,770
Lizzie?

491
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,050
Where were you?
Where the fuck were you?

492
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,290
Give me the gun, Lizzie.

493
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,090
Lizzie. I'm sorry.

494
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,330
Fuck off! Fuck off!

495
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,460
Lizzie, just go. Go on. GO!

496
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,610
Officers...

497
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,330
Officers, I was taking a shit
and I heard voices, Irish voices.

498
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,690
Then I heard a shot.

499
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,220
I swear to God, there's
a soldier lying dead in there.

500
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,210
Get every man in uniform
around the king!

501
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,370
Every man in uniform
around the king!

502
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,500
Right now.

503
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,460
The IRA are on the course.

504
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,740
Everyone to the king!
The Royal Enclosure now!

505
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,450
All right, make ready, boys,
this is it.

506
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,450
Right, you four get round the back.

507
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,210
You take three of your boys...

508
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,330
Scudboat, come on... Show them guns.

509
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,410
Right, you come with us
and you stay back.

510
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,780
Let's go!

511
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,300
Put your hands in the air.

512
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,340
Turn around!

513
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,770
Is there a problem?

514
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,210
There are Fenians on the course.
A soldier's been shot.

515
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,570
Someone said there was
an Irishman in here.

516
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,980
That was correct.

517
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,820
Very sorry, sir.

518
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,700
Shadow Security to His Majesty.

519
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,210
I will now take
command of the situation.

520

MUSIC: Come On Over by Royal Blood

521
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,060
Mr Sabini, you're late.
Have a seat.

522
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,890
What happened to your nose?

523
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,010
You want to have that
brother of yours put down.

524
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,570
I tried that. He bit the vet.

525
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,330
I told the coppers that
you're a fucking Gypsy racketeer

526
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,290
Peaky Blinder and they're coming,

527
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,330
they are going to throw you
out before the king comes up here.

528
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,780
Well, from what I saw,
the police are a bit busy right now.

529
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,220
Did you win any money today,
Mr Sabini?

530
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,260
Where are our coppers?

531
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,090
I said to that sergeant one minute,
he said two,

532
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,770
and it's fucking ten.

533
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,860
Like I told you, they're a bit busy.

534
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,930
Same as my boys.

535
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,330
~ What the fuck does that mean?
~ What does that mean?

536
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,410
Well, my boys are on the track
having a little bonfire.

537
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,460
Gaming licences, you know.

538
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,140
Fuck...

539
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,810
You placed too much reliance
on the police

540
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,740
for your security, Mr Sabini.

541
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,220
That was a mistake.

542
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,690
No, no. Think about who you are.

543
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,370
Think about where you are.

544
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,330
You pull a weapon,
you are the king's assassin.

545
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,420
Sit down and stay calm.

546
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,410
Good.

547
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,850
Now, your next mistake, Mr Sabini,

548
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,820
was breaking your promise
with Alfie Solomons.

549
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,140
You promised Alfie that his bookies
could come to Epsom.

550
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,500
He was very hurt when you said no.
He was very hurt.

551
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,780
And that is why me
and Alfie are back in business.

552
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,580
Police! All right!

553
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,220
It's all right, officers,
he's just a bad loser.

554
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,460
You fucking lose, you fucking
Gypsy bastard!! You lose!

555
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,730
What the fuck are you looking at?!

556
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,660
Step back! Move!

557
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,780
You are now a prisoner of
the Red Right Hand.

558
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,300
Now, take his hat and gun.
Get him up.

559
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,020
Easy...

560
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,850
Take a seat.

561
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,300
Now, you make
yourself nice and comfortable.

562
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,500
We're just going for a wee
drive, Mr Shelby.

563
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,100
Let's go.

564
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,260
I guessed
and then John confirmed it.

565
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,180
Guessed what? Who are you?

566
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,580
I'm May Carleton.
I trained Tommy Shelby's horse.

567
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,260
And you're the woman who
he said was going to sail away.

568
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,460
I see he didn't tell you about me.

569
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,570
He did tell me about you.
I wonder if that's significant.

570
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,970
Tell me what about you?

571
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,900
You have any idea where he is?

572
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,020
I'm waiting for him here.

573
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,970
There's been trouble on the track.

574
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,690
All the bookies
have had their licences burned.

575
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,610
Shouldn't you be down with
the horses...

576
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,730
Which means they will have to
re-apply for their legal pitches.

577
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,410
It's all part of Tommy's
plan for the future.

578
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,290
What do you know about Tommy's
future?

579
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,410
The applications will be
denied, of course.

580
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,700
And all the pitches will be
allocated instead to Tommy's
bookies.

581
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,860
I know because I'll make sure of it.

582
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,580
I have influence with the board.

583
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,610
There's business and there's love.

584
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,180
Is there?

585
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,700
With Thomas Shelby?

586
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,330
What do you want from him?

587
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,060
The same as you.

588
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,060
I want to feel alive.

589
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,580
Did he tell you my name?

590
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,020
My name is Grace.

591
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,730
In your statement to the House, sir,
I believe that you should say

592
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,810
that witnesses heard the killers
say that they were

593
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,370
members of the IRA
and that the killing

594
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,020
was in retribution for actions of
the Field Marshal in County Cork.

595
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,290
Oh... Our friend from Birmingham?

596
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,940
He has been taken care of.

597
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,050
Oh... A very good day, sir.

598
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,370
Thank...

599
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,500
Oh... Sorry, I must go. Goodbye.

600
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,700
Polly.

601
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,380
Tommy told me you'd be here.

602
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,050
And I told Tommy it should be me
who finishes you.

603
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:36,330
Small and weak.
That's how you like it, isn't it?

604
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,620
Well, this time small
and weak has got a gun.

605
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,410
You wouldn't do that here.

606
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,930
No?

607
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,410
Do you see any coppers? I don't.

608
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,740
They're all around
your precious king.

609
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,700
Polly. Polly...

610
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,130
~ Some part of you...
~ I have no parts.

611
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,770
Some part of you wanted me, as well.
I know that.

612
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:21,860
I felt it.

613
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,460
And sure as hell some part of me
wants you still.

614
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,460
Not just that part.

615
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,140
Some part of my soul.

616
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,650
Some part of my soul.

617
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,090
Curious how that is to me...

618
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,060
And curious that it should be you.

619
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,180
Opposites, perhaps.

620
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:55,290
Opposites. And that... that thing
sticking in my heart you own.

621
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:59,170
You own part of that heart.
You do. You do, Polly.

622
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,340
You do.

623
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,420
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

Put your money away before
I take it off you.

632
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:29,690
Fucking clear off!

633
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:31,370
Get up!

634
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,610
Lizzie. What the fuck
are you doing here?

635
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,290
Working for Tommy.
Same as all of us.

636
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,850
You work for the Blinders?

637
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,730
What happened to you?

638
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,850
Fell over.

639
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,570
Don't fucking give me that.

640
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,740
Lizzie... Come here, come on,
come here.

641
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,340
Come here... Were you working?

642
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,010
Yeah? Thought you'd earn yourself
a few bob at the races, eh?

643
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,170
This has got to stop, Lizzie.

644
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,370
It's got to stop.
Tommy has already told you.

645
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:04,370
The toffs at the races
are the worst. You know that.

646
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,130
Come here, come here.
Look at me...

647
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,290
Cheer up. We won.

648
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,210
We fucking took Epsom!

649
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,010
We kicked the Cockneys'
fucking arses.

650
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,530
Congratu-fucking-lations.

651
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,650
We fucking beat them, all right.

652
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,730
John didn't even shoot his gun.

653
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,580
We're kings.
Kings of the fucking world!

654
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,610
John?

655
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,020
I don't see the same thing
in your eyes that I see in Tommy's.

656
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,170
You should get out.

657
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,100
You should get out.

658
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,450
Where is Tommy anyway?

659
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,980
Were any of you boys in France?

660
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,820
Allow a man a cigarette?

661
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,460
The Somme. Black Woods.

662
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,020
The Somme. The Bulge.

663
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,860
Smoke.

664
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,260
So fucking close.

665
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,860
So fucking close.

666
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,660
Oh... And there's a woman.

667
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,500
Yeah.

668
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,300
A woman...

669
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,940
.. I love.

670
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,020
And I got close.

671
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,580
I nearly got FUCKING EVERYTHING!

672
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,580
Ah, what the fuck.

673
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,700
Get it done, boys.

674
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,410
Comrade, we have our orders.

675
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,580
You know how it is.

676
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,140
I know how it is.

677
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,570
In the bleak mid winter.

678
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,450
At some point in the near future,

679
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,300
Mr Churchill will want to
speak to you in person, Mr Shelby.

680
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,490
He has a job for you.

681
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,980
We will be in touch.

682
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,100
Get out of the grave, tinker!

683
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,250
Be on your fucking way!
