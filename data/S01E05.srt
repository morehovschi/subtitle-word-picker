00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,300
They will keep asking me questions
(that) I don't know the answer to

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,760
It's us that have the machine guns
now and it's them that's in the mud

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,710
Guns, Mr Shelby.
We'd pay good money.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,030
For who do you speak?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
The Irish Republican Army.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,030
What are you? Copper?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,000
GUNSHOT

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,030
You went after him
because he was IRA.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,790
I followed him because I thought
he might have information.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,440
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,110
Your sister's in there giving birth.
There's one man who should be here.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,150
You are right, Poll. On my oath.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,120
Tell Freddie it's safe.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
Welcome to the world, son.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,430
Freddie.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,390
Pol!

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,630
The police came
and took his father away.

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,800
You liar!

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,910
Open up, love. I brought more
things for you and the baby.

31
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,230
I've got some fresh eggs and
bread...

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,470
I'll leave it here.

DOOR SLAMS SHUT

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,110
Did you speak to her?

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
She didn't speak back.

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,070
Well, did you tell her?

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,160
I'll only tell her what
I know to be true.

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,390
It's the last time
I am going to say this.

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,520
It wasn't me
who shopped Freddie Thorne.

46
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,270
Tommy...

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,110
I'd ask you to swear on the Bible,

48
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
but you can't swear on that,
can you?

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
Nothing you hold is sacred.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,600
There's tea.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,760
The new system...

52
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,950
..everything in the diary, eh?

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Mm-hm.

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,150
A black star? What does that
mean?

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
The black star day...

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,590
..is the day we
take out Billy Kimber and his men.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,640
No-one knows this!

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,080
Not even your family?

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Grace...

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,560
..everyone in my family
hates me. Why would I tell them?

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,430
He's off the bloody rails,
is what he is.

62
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,670
If he'll turn nose on his
best mate...

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,630
Bloody neighbours, John.
Snitch behind the curtain.

64
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,710
If you think that,
you're the only one who does.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,350
Look at this, look.
Bloody raking it in.

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,670
Who's running this carny?

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,790
Name of Marston. Intends on wintering
in Smallheath with this ring.

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,550
Does he! Ain't he heard nobody in
Smallheath craps in a pot

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,150
without the decree of
Tommy Almighty?

70
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,830
Mr Marston, I believe?
The ringmaster?

71
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,990
Proud I am to say so.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,270
Yes, well,
these here are civilised parts.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,190
Man wants to set his stall up with
fellas lamping each other,

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,430
he needs himself a licence.

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,560
A licence.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,360
For a fee. From those in charge.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,790
I'll tell you what.

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,910
How about I keep my money, and you
shove a licence up your arsecrack?

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,550
You don't want to speak to me
like that.

80
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,710
And who the bloody hell do
you think you are?

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,400
My name is Arthur Shelby.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Dad?

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
Jesus.

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
Thank you. You are a good boy.

85
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,190
Bless you, Father, for these
bounties we are about to receive...

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,430
Jesus Christ...

87
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Please, woman...

88
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,630
..not in vain.

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
Finish your sandwich
and sling your hook.

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,550
Pollyanna.

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,070
I'm the guest of the head
of this family,

92
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,310
so why don't you tend
to your mangle or your scuttle?

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
The head of the family ain't here.

94
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
Tommy...he sometimes helps me
with business.

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Ah. Well. Speak of the devil.

96
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
How are you, son?

97
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Get out.

98
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Come on, son. I'm a changed man.

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,720
This family needed you ten years ago
when you walked out on it.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,190
Not now. Get out of this house.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,590
Tommy, he's different...

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
You shut up.

103
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,960
It's all right, son.

104
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,680
Arthur Shelby never stays where
he is not welcome.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
Quite something you've become.

106
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
Bye, son.

107
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,240
He's our dad.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
He's a selfish bastard.

109
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
You calling someone a selfish
bastard?

110
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,710
That's a bit rich, Tommy.

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,270
I mean, thanks to you...

112
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,510
..we're already down a bloody
sister.

113
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,390
If you want to see him, Arthur...

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,560
You want to see him?
You can go with him.

115
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,990
Grace...

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,110
I am taking five pounds
from petty cash all right?

117
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,030
We don't have five pounds in
petty cash.

118
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,910
Then I'll take what we've got.

119
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,480
Count it and leave a receipt.

120
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,110
Arthur, there are some things in the
books that I don't understand.

121
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,710
Likewise. Every week we pay
one pound and ten shillings

122
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,710
by postal order to a "Daniel Owen"
in London.

123
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,790
Danny Whizz Bang, hangs round the
pubs in Camden Town Wharf for us.

124
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,070
He keeps his ears open for business.

125
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,350
He's a good man.

126
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,990
I thought Danny Whizz Bang was dead.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,990
Then you thought wrong, didn't you?

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,710
But I've seen his grave.
He was shot.

129
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,630
That was a show to satisfy the wops.

130
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Tommy just shot some
sheep's brains at him.

131
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
Who is buried in his grave?

132
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,630
Now look, Grace, if you know what's
good for you,

133
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,430
you don't ask questions about things
that don't concern you.

134
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,630
Never. Right!

135
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
And that's for you.

136
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
And don't tell Tommy I took this.

137
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,710
The boy needs a hiding,
if you ask me.

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,670
Yeah, well, Aunt Polly's close to
giving him one.

139
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,710
John and Ada too, it sounds like.

140
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,640
John moans on bloody principle -
but if you saw his Mrs...

141
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
You have a girl yourself, son?

142
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,880
P'raps when it suits Tommy, eh?

143
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,150
Yeah, well...

144
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,190
..he's been different, you know,
since the war.

145
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,550
Yeah, well...

146
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,350
the war can change a man.

147
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,030
Speaking for myself, anyway.

148
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,470
Where did you fight, Dad?

149
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,670
All over, son, all over.

150
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,070
Yeah, all over.

151
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,870
Then the salvation of Jesus Christ
spread his light over me,

152
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,230
and, as a pilgrim,
I come to visit the New World...

153
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,510
America.

154
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,200
..where I beheld the future.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,390
Casinos!
Money factories, son.

156
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,590
Look, I've been studying
the competition,

157
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,990
their schemes, their systems.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,230
Look at that...
Show me.

159
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,520
It's all there.
There's a fortune to be made here.

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm an old man, and my heart's a
battered vessel. But within...

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,400
..there still beats the
fluttering pulse of a dream...

162
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,520
The Shelby Casino and Hotel...

163
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,150
Gents and dames will come
flocking from all corners -

164
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,550
New York, Chicago, Boston -

165
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,950
to The Shelby, where I can stand
proudly

166
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,310
with my dear children by my side.

167
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,800
And the women there!

168
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,190
Like fresh peaches.

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,520
Thou could have a dozen.

170
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,070
We'd all of us be kings!

171
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
How much, how much to get started?

172
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,280
The oak needs but an acorn.

173
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,990
Let's do it.

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,030
Let's do it.
Let's bloody do it.

175
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,870
It would make my heart beam...

176
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,910
but I don't want to cause
any discord between the brothers.

177
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,950
So, please, why don't you talk to
Tommy first...?

178
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm sick of taking orders from him.

179
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,670
Tommy's not the only one in the
family with a head for business,

180
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,830
and Shelby money is Shelby money.

181
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,960
I thank God for my wonderful sons.

182
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,510
This is cause for a celebration!

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,240
Yeah. Slange. Slange.

184
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
On your feet, soldier!

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,680
On your feet.

186
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,110
Dad, I don't want to fight you, Dad.

187
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,710
Come on, boy!
I'm old enough to be thy father.

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
Hit him! Hit him! That's it! Hit him!

189
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,870
On your feet.

190
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,270
Get up.

191
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,960
All right!

192
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,200
That's it!

193
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,400
Is that all you've got, boy?

194
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,440
Get up.

195
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,280
This here is Arthur Shelby Junior!
My son.

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,910
I love him, and I'm proud of him,

197
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,750
and he can fight
any one of yous in here.

198
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

199
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,390
You did good, son. You did good.

200
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,640
I love you, Dad. I love you.

201
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
Mr Shelby?

202
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,560
Who's asking?

203
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,960
My name is Byrne.

204
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,480
I had word from your man in Camden
Town that you wanted to parley.

205
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Then parley it is.

206
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,230
A few months ago a man named Ryan
came to this place with

207
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,790
a view to buying some
goods from you.

208
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,590
Mr Ryan met with an accident.
He was shot.

209
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,750
I heard... He was a man with a
quick mouth. I know that.

210
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,430
I wondered
if he had made any enemies in here.

211
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,510
None that I know of.

212
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,350
It's not the kind of place
to make enemies.

213
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,950
All are welcome here, Mr Byrne...

214
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,510
Including Irish?

215
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Especially Irish.

216
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,350
Ryan told you he was a member
of the Irish Republican Army.

217
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Was he still welcome?

218
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,630
Like I say,
any man that buys beer is welcome.

219
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Perhaps you didn't believe him.

220
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,150
In pubs sometimes people say things

221
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,190
and sometimes it's
the whisky talking.

222
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
It's hard to tell which is which.

223
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,750
As a teetotal man I find it amusing.

224
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,270
Except when it ends in tragedy.

225
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,430
Would you like some cordial
and water, Mr Byrne?

226
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,150
You see, Mr Shelby, Ryan,
for all his quick mouth,

227
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,520
was indeed connected.

228
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,110
Very well connected...to our
brotherhood.

229
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,960
By membership and blood.
He was my cousin.

230
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,160
I am from South Armagh.

231
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
I am a man of influence there.

232
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Cordial and water would be grand,
Mr Shelby.

233
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,790
Grace. Bring some water
and cordial to the snug.

234
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,760
Yes, Mr Shelby.

235
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,390
My cousin came to buy guns.

236
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,760
And I told him I had none.

237
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,720
Your man Danny Owen talks a lot
when he's drunk.

238
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,790
He says the Peaky Blinders
do have the guns.

239
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,750
Robbed from the factory
down the road.

240
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,750
He boasts about a stack of
Lewis machine guns.

241
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,470
And enough belts of ammunition to
hold up God's trousers.

242
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,310
Yep. That sounds like our Danny.

243
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,560
He has an imagination.

244
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,000
Like I said, sometimes it's the
whisky that does the talking.

245
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,790
He says only the brothers
know where the guns are kept.

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,830
Well, Danny also says he sees
German infantrymen on the backs

247
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,320
of milk carts. And he shoots them
with his broomstick.

248
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,960
We have men in the BSA factory.

249
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,630
They say it's you who has them.

250
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
And we have men who
work in the police station.

251
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,670
Every finger, Mr Shelby,
every finger in this city,

252
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,880
points in one direction.

253
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Please don't mistake me for a fool.

254
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,310
Let me get to the point.

255
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,710
I don't care what kind of
half-arsed tinker operation

256
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,990
you have going here.

257
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,590
But I can assure you,

258
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,080
I represent a very different
category of organization.

259
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,200
My cousin was shot.

260
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,720
I am judge, jury and executioner.

261
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I find you guilty
and I pass sentence.

262
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,350
You deliver the guns to me

263
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,950
or I deliver death and hell's fury

264
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,720
to you and your little tribe of
heathens.

265
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,120
Am I making myself clear?

266
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,470
Let me confess something to you.

267
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,000
And only to you.

268
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,430
I have the guns...

269
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
..but they have become
a burden to me.

270
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,680
Perhaps it is time
to unload that burden.

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
For the right price.

272
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,960
CHATTERING

273
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,840
MAN CLEARS THROAT

274
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Malachi Byrne.

275
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
Brigade commander of
the South Armagh IRA.

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,830
You've hooked yourself
a big fish there.

277
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,950
With these guns as bait who knows
what we'll catch?

278
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,990
'We'?

279
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,870
Are you suggesting that you and I
could work together as a team?

280
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,680
Perhaps we have more in common than
you think, Inspector.

281
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,670
Can you deliver him?

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,430
With your help.

283
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,600
And I want word put out in Ireland
that I was not involved.

284
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,190
So, I would be solving
a problem for you.

285
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
And I would be winning you
that medal.

286
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,800
If I get a medal I will have your
initials engraved on the backside.

287
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,120
My initials on your backside.
Now, that's quite an image.

288
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,030
Inspector, since we are getting
along so well,

289
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
can you answer me a question?

290
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,640
Who gave you Freddie Thorne?

291
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,600
As everyone in the city knows.

292
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,320
It was you, Mr Shelby.

293
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,920
KNOCKS ON DOOR

294
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,280
MUSIC: "Ball and Biscuit" by
The White Stripes

295
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
Hello, son.

296
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
It's all there.

297
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,680
It is indeed.

298
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,910
We're going to build something with
this, son. Something magnificent.

299
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,350
When do we sail, Dad?

300
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,550
Hungry for work, are you?
Yeah.

301
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,030
A ship sails Friday.
Meet me at the boxing ring.

302
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,750
Right. Friday.

303
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,840
Friday.

304
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,480
KNOCKS ON DOOR

305
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
KNOCKS CONTINUE

306
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,240
Leave that open.

307
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,110
No.

308
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,310
Are you expecting trouble?
Yeah.

309
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,870
At this hour?
Midnight is as good an hour as any.

310
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,270
What the hell is going on?

311
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,070
When the St Andrew's bell strikes
midnight,

312
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,710
two IRA men are going to come
through that door.

313
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,150
When they have what they want,
they plan to kill me.

314
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,990
It's your job to stop that
happening.

315
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,710
You could have given me
some warning.

316
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,790
I just got the message myself.

317
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,070
They want to meet me here alone.

318
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,950
And barmaids don't count?
No. Barmaids don't count.

319
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,910
Now, you're going to be in the
back room.

320
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,710
I am going to be sitting there.

321
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,790
When I make a toast, you're going to
come out with that thing raised.

322
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,560
You don't shoot, you just point,
I'll do the rest.

323
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,990
Will you kill them?

324
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,990
No, the police want them alive...
The police know about this?

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,030
Look, you just hold it up

326
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,550
and you just point. Right?

327
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,400
BELL BEGINS TO RING

328
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Right, go, go. Go on, go.

329
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,920
BELL TOLLS MIDNIGHT

330
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,390
We'll hold back here.

331
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,150
If damage is done to either side,
it's no concern of ours.

332
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,520
BELL CONTINUES TO TOLL

333
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
Lost your thirst, eh?

334
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,040
Just show us where.

335
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,960
Give me the cash.

336
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,080
You're going to need a shovel.

337
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,360
HE LAUGHS

338
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,830
You thick fucking tinker.

339
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,600
Did you think we'd let you live?

340
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,560
Make your peace, Mr Shelby.

341
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,680
I will make my peace my own way.

342
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,800
To barmaids who don't count...

343
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,160
Why did you shoot?

344
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,750
Why did you shoot, Grace?

345
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
I didn't know I had it
in me like that.

346
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,840
So, now you've seen me.

347
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,400
And you've seen me...

348
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,480
..and I'm sorry.

349
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,950
You were supposed to come
on the sixth chime.

350
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,960
You were supposed to come
on the fucking sixth chime.

351
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,720
They refused to surrender.

352
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
They fought well.
They were brave men.

353
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
Well, he looks like he was
killed by a wild fucking animal.

354
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,150
Still...

355
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,270
This never happened and they were
never here, who cares?

356
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,470
Will you get the bodies out of here.

357
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,400
All right, are they...? Are they
making the lady uncomfortable?

358
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,960
I'll leave you
two love birds to it then, eh?

359
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,760
Thank you.

360
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,990
First of all, let me
say I had no idea he would

362
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,590
involve you in this ugly business.

363
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,670
If I had,
I never would have let it happen.

364
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,950
He trusts me. I told you that.

365
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,200
You didn't believe me.

366
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,070
Sergeant Moss made a report.
Which, of course, I have burnt.

367
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,280
He said that when he entered
the room, you were embracing.

368
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,560
Is that your primary concern?
An embrace?

369
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,150
My...my concern is your welfare.

370
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,560
It was me who killed them.

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,120
I had no control.

372
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,160
You have been living with beasts.

373
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,960
It was the beast that
tried to stop me.

374
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,240
I believe last night
something inside me changed.

375
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,710
I no longer feel
the need to avenge my father.

376
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,080
The hatred that I brought with me
here has gone.

377
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,230
And therefore my reasons for joining
the service.

378
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,320
You want to resign?

379
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,440
I think our mission has come
to a natural end.

380
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,990
I think I know where the
guns are hidden.

381
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,990
You do? So? Tell me where.

382
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,550
If I am right,
and the guns are found,

383
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,710
you will have no more business
with Thomas Shelby.

384
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,590
Is that not so?
Our military mission will be over.

385
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
And we can leave
the city as we found it.

386
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,950
Are you trying to...
do a deal with me?

387
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,430
Because if you are,
you must be explicit.

388
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,270
I want your word that
Thomas Shelby will not be harmed

389
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,030
if the guns are recovered.

390
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,360
Your word as a gentleman.

391
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,870
Will you give it?

392
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,400
Why...would you want to save him?

393
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,030
A residue of sympathy.

394
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,720
Sympathy? You mean sentiment?

395
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,430
Yes.

396
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,080
In his way, he has been kind to me.

397
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,670
Sentiment.

398
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Yes.

399
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,200
You are too
good-hearted for this work.

400
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,160
Perhaps.

401
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,800
So, for my sake,
will you spare him?

402
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,360
You have my word.

403
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,310
A week after the robbery there was a
burial at St Andrews' churchyard.

404
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I have found out the man supposed
to be buried is alive.

405
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,070
Arthur is quite transparent.

406
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,510
I learned that the funeral was
attended only by the brothers.

407
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,590
And the grave that was dug was
far deeper than your average

408
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,880
and was lined with lead...

409
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,160
..to keep out the damp.

410
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,680
The guns are buried in that grave.

411
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
Then, tonight,
we will dig up the grave.

431
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,320
Good.

432
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,590
So, I am no longer your
superior officer and

433
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,040
you are no longer my subordinate.

434
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,640
And therefore...

435
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,880
..regulations permit me...

436
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
to offer you this.

437
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,360
I am...I am a simple man,
but a good man.

438
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,680
And my admiration for you...

439
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,440
..has turned to love.

440
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,320
I don't ask for love in return.
Just...

441
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,440
..recognition that we are
like minds...

442
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,160
..with shared values.

443
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Grace...

444
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
..will you marry me?

445
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
Mr Campbell...

446
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,520
..you deserve better.

447
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,400
Is it him between us?

448
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,360
Is it the beast that dug that grave?
Is it him?

449
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
My resignation will be with
you in the morning...

450
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,200
WHISTLE BLOWS

451
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Dad!

452
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,750
Hullo, son.
May I ask who gave my whereabouts?

453
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,470
Marston.

454
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,830
Said you left him last night with
a bill for your whores.

455
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,030
Well, at least
we got to say goodbye, son.

456
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,480
And bid a fond adieu to your
dear brothers, would you?

457
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,030
How...how could you do this to us?

458
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,110
Do what, son?

459
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,480
All that stuff you said
about...the Shelby Casino...

460
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,390
..and Atlantic City.

461
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,950
Well, if the truth be told,
I've not been

462
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,120
so acquainted with that promised
land as I had thee believe.

463
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,390
You're a fucking liar and a thief.

464
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
You give me back my fucking money.

465
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,070
"Do not despise the thief,
if he steals to

466
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
"satisfy his starvation"

467
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,360
That's in the Holy Bible, son.

468
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,120
And I've starved for so very long.

469
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,200
Fare thee well, son.

470
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,120
I waited for you.

471
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,800
I waited.

472
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,510
Listen to me, boy.
You are not in the prize ring now.

473
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,950
If you ever put your hands on me
again,

474
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,320
I'll cut your fucking throat
and spread you on these tracks.

475
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,800
DOOR OPENS

476
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,400
Where's your father?

477
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,950
I'm assuming he's busy frittering
the 500 you took from us

478
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,880
and put in his thieving,
whore-groping hands.

479
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,110
What were you thinking?

480
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,880
How dare you do something like that
without talking to Thomas or me?

481
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,720
Does Tommy know?

482
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,840
No. But you're going to tell him.

483
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,870
You might take
satisfaction in a great victory.

484
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,640
A terrible consequence has been
avoided.

485
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,510
'Those guns that we dug up will
never be used to murder the innocent

486
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,870
'or usurp the status quo.

487
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,270
'But, even though we have solved a
crime,

488
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,950
'we have as yet failed to
punish the criminal.'

489
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,230
This man who dug that grave has
also dug his own.

490
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,950
He has proved himself a deadly
menace to the King's peace.

491
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,950
'And tonight we will strike
him down.

492
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,390
'We will drive our swords
through his black heart,

493
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,590
'we will pursue him into the
rat holes that he infests.'

494
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,030
And, finally,
we will rid this city of his kind.

495
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,240
Justice will be done and will be
seen to be done.

496
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
Amen.

497
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,550
There's going to be trouble now,
Finn.

498
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,590
You look after yourself,
do you hear me?

499
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,560
I'm going to be going away for a
while. Right... Go on.

500
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,590
Right... Who wants to fucking fight?

501
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:52,270
Fighting's over.
We're closing up and moving on.

502
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,950
I said who wants to fucking fight?

503
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,960
My name is Arthur fucking Shelby!

504
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,950
Who dares to fight me?!

505
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,840
Go home, lad. Before you catch
yourself a spanking.

506
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,390
My brother in Digbeth just says
the police are coming down

507
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,510
from Deritend in numbers.

508
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,120
Asking for Tommy Shelby by name.

509
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,480
Shit.

510
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,030
I'm going to have to lie low
for a while. Why?

511
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,510
I lost my bargaining power.

512
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,310
This copper, it's just me
and him now.

513
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,560
When I get back...

514
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,470
..I'll tell you some things.

515
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,990
Harry said the police
are already in Digbeth.

516
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,670
Yeah. You took a chance
coming here, why?

517
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,510
The police are in the lane, Tommy.

518
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Come with me.

519
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,680
HE SLAMS THE GUN DOWN

520
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,400
I'm looking
for Thomas Shelby.

521
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,000
Never heard of him.

522
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,200
You'll never find him.

523
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,640
Go home.

524
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,400
Perhaps I should ask
the question again.

525
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,240
On your knees.

526
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,520
Now, understand this, barman.

527
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,150
I don't care if you live or die.

528
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,320
I don't know.

529
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,000
He left...

530
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,760
..with the barmaid.

531
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,680
He left with Grace.

532
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,360
I think they were going to
her place.

533
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Call it off.

534
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,750
I don't understand, sir.
We should find the barmaid...

535
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,720
Call it all off!

536
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
All of it!

537
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,840
Get in.

538
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,960
It's not much of a place.

539
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,630
It's all right.

540
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,950
You want tea?

541
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,710
Tea? No.

542
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,470
I have rum...

543
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,430
Actually, tea it is.

544
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,990
You want to impress me?

545
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Yes. And do you have a biscuit?

546
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,200
No. They attract mice.

547
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,310
People look different at home.

548
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,200
In what way?

549
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Off guard.

550
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,710
Should I be on my guard?

551
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
No, I'm a man who drinks tea.

552
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,280
When the trouble dies down, I'll go.

553
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,040
When will it die down, do you think?

554
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,520
Late, I would say.

555
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,000
So, not until the morning then.

556
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,520
Yes. I'd say I'll be here
till morning.

557
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,750
You have a gramophone?

558
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,870
It's broken.

559
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,120
We could still dance.

560
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Yes. Why not.

561
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
I know you like to be asked
properly.

562
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,720
Grace, can I have this dance?

563
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,520
Are you OK?

564
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,960
I don't hear
the shovels against the wall.

565
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,600
What shovels?

566
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Will you help me?

567
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,550
Help you with what?

568
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,640
With everything...

569
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,830

573
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,280
And you found me.
