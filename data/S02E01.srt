Amen.

29
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,050
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

30
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,490
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

31
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,220
if he should pass before me.

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,170
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law -

33
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,610
when we were in France,
fighting for the King.

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,940
Amen.

35
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,930
And in the end it wasn't war
that took Freddie.

36
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,050
Pestilence took him.

37
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,340
Come here.

38
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,570
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

39
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,260
before he was cruelly taken.

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,250
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

41
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
you might come back to Birmingham.

42
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,050
God, do you know how funny it is

43
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,930
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

44
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,210
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

45
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,690
Do you know how unfair it is

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,780
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

47
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,180
So now they've made you
ashamed of us, eh?

48
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,970
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

49
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,730
Karl's with his cousins.

50
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,100
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

51
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,250
Ada, are you coming home?

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,660
I'm going home.

53
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,610
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

54
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,300
That's not what I said.

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,570
There's another reason
we want you home.

56
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,330
We're planning an expansion.

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm taking premises in London...

58
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,370
~ Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait. ~ Polly,

59
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,890
if Ada was weeping then I'd stop.

60
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,410
But she's not.

61
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,490
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

62
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,610
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

63
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,180
Yeah, well,
I'm not a Shelby anymore.

64
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,300
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,340
I'm free.

66
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,820
I've got to get Karl home.

67
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,050
I told you. Let me do it.

68
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,730
It's all right.

69
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,100
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

70
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,580
"Till the danger passes"?

71
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,580
That'll be the bloody day.

72
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,610
It happened at exactly 7am.

73
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,340
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

74
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,940
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

75
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
I'd say it was something
to do with the gas.

76
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,660
It's just been fitted.

77
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,690
Madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

78
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,700
Madam!

79
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,660
This is all over the place.

80
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,140
Confetti.

81
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,210
You can go.

82
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,300
Right.

83
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,420
Who?

84
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,540
Who did this to us?

85
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,540
Whisky. Irish.

86
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,650
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

87
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,250
Gas and electric don't mix.

88
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,490
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

89
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,940
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

90
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,420
You know something?

91
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,410
In these times of hunger
and hardship,

92
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,340
business is surprisingly good.

93
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,700
Which one of you is
the Peaky Blinder devil?

94
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,900

109
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,660
Polly.

110
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,450
Did he say who did it?

111
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,050
He's gone to the Black Lion.

112
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,810
On his own?

113
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,370
Tommy does everything on his own.

114
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,130
~ Should I go to the Black Lion?
~ What?

115
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,050
~ Should I go there and see him? ~ No.

116
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,010
Where the fuck is Arthur?

117
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,050
Protecting the Garrison's
whisky from the police.

118
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,940
For fuck's sake!

119
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,780
Polly, it feels a little bit to me
like things are getting out of hand.

120
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,380
So get 'em in hand.

121
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,780
Do you know what Ada said to me
this morning?

122
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,860
She said we all look like we work
in a factory under the ground.

123
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,340
She said we look like ghosts.

124
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,500
She'll be back.

125
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,090
When?

126
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
When she needs us.

127
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,410
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

128
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,290
~ Six. ~ Six what?

129
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,140
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

130
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,300
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

131
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,340
Why?

132
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,580
Seven.

133
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,290
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

134
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,420
or we'll find somebody else who can.

135
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,660
Thomas Shelby.

136
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,060
You blew up my pub.

137
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,900
Anger defeats fear, good.

138
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,580
You blew up my pub.

139
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,490
Tommy has a reputation to uphold.

140
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,410
A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

141
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,820
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

142
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,420
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

143
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,730
I read somewhere that you Paddies

144
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,100
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

145
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,010
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

146
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,090
That's funny, don't you think?

147
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,860
A war about peace.

148
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,170
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

149
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,180
Forgive me, I get confused.

150
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,420
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

151
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,460
So stop fucking smiling.

152
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,930
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

153
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,730
You have a son at the
Cherry Wood Road School in Harborne.

154
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,890
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

155
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,740
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

156
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,970
Poor boy if the race was important.

157
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,290
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

158
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,530
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

159
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,820
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

160
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,580
No.

161
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,450
He researches his enemies,

162
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,700
that's why he's been chosen.

163
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,500
I am chosen?

164
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,380
I'm chosen.

165
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,220
Can the chosen one smoke?

166
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,780
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

167
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,540
Chosen by whom?

168
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,260
By an informed consensus.

169
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
I have things to do.

170
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,770
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

171
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,940
what he's been chosen for.

172
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,490
From now on, Mr Shelby,

173
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,460
you shut your fucking Gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

174
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,860
Fuck!

175
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,930
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

176
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,250
clear of coppers between
midnight and four tonight.

177
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,180
Right. Could I ask why?

178
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,810
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

179
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,730
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

180
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,580
That's all. You can go.

181
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,650
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

182
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,180
No charge.

183
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,130
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

184
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,170
Just passing through, he says.

185
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,130
He's very grand these days.

186
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,770
He's head of some
secret department -

187
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,140
the Irish Desk.

188
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,740
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

189
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,380
I'll say good night, Tom.

190
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,060
I want to speak to a representative!

191
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,810
Father! Father!

192
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,570
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

193
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,250
Get the fuck off me!

194
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,090
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

195
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,650
I demand to speak to
a representative
of His Majesty the King!

196
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,850
Make your peace with God.

197
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,810
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

198
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,170
~ Father. ~ Come on.

199
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,740
Where are you going?

200
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,010
Does someone here have
business with the King?

201
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,610
Major Campbell.

202
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,940
About time.

203
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,570
I am a very busy man, Governor.

204
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,370
In seven and a half minutes,

205
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,890
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

206
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

207
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,540
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

208
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,490
No, Governor,

209
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,060
I hear no bells.

210
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,410
Since yesterday morning,

211
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,410
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

212
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,890
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

213
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,810
It's a little late to be coming up
with nonsense like that,

214
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,010
don't you think?

215
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,090
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

216
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,370
there would be a last-minute pardon,

217
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,260
which has not materialised.

218
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,050
Forgive me, Governor,

219
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,500
but what business is this of mine?

220
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,170
He says the man who hired him

221
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,130
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

222
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,620
an Ulsterman.

223
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,010
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

224
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,690
a bullet wound in his right leg.

225
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,460
No...

226
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
Still no bells. Governor...

227
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,570
..you have a very clear remit.

228
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,250
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

229
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,260
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

230
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,460
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man...

231
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,730
..to the gates of hell.

232
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,820
Is that clear?

233
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,530
And...if you should ever have
the desire

234
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,060
to discuss this matter
with anyone else...

235
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,980
..I know where you live.

236
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,620
Arthur,
Tommy's called a family meeting.

237
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,450
Arthur!

238
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,850
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

239
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,220
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

240
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,780
Arthur!

241
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,020
2,000.

242
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,420
Come on.

243
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,420
Sit down, Finn.

244
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,180
~ Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
~ He's on his way.

245
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,980
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

246
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Whisky - left over from
the explosion.

247
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,100
It's good stuff, as well.

248
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,490
Right...

249
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,690
Before Tommy gets here,

250
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,010
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

251
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,570
between the rest of us.

252
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,740
YOU think?

253
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah.

254
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,820
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

255
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,180
..when did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

256
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,450
If you have anything to say,
you wait for Thomas.

257
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,970
Polly's fucking right.

258
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,180
I see all the books.

259
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,060
Legal and off track.

260
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,220
Sort of stuff you don't see.

261
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,210
And in the past year

262
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,730
the Shelby Company Limited

263
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,090
has been making £150...

264
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,620
a day.

265
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,970
Right? A fucking day.

266
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,890
Sometimes more.

267
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,610
So what I want to know

268
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,570
is why are we changing things?

269
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,020
Polly, look what's happened already.

270
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,930
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

271
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,090
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

272
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,570
~ Who said anything
about cockneys? ~ Who else?

273
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,530
Do you know who did it, do you?

274
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,700
No, she doesn't know who did it.

275
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,170
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

276
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,020
Everyone's allowed to speak.

277
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,140
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

278
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,980
I speak for our household.

279
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,490
~ So... ~ John, this company
is a modern enterprise

280
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,090
and believes in
equal rights for women.

281
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,660
On your feet, Esme.

282
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,330
I'm not a blood member
of this family

283
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,410
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm NOT a member

284
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,580
I can see things
in a different light.

285
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,250
So I'll get to my point.

286
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,970
That would be nice.

287
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,330
As my husband said,

288
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,570
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

289
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,890
But London...

290
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,820
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

291
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,650
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

292
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,290
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

293
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,660
And there are foreigners
of every description...

294
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,460
..and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

295
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,250
I have a child,

296
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,060
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

297
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,700
I want John to see him grow up.

298
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,170
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

299
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,100
and keep chickens or something.

300
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,770
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

301
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,940
"Thomas"?

302
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
That's all I have to say.

303
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,420
That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

304
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,970
Wash them down with a nice drink.

305
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,260
Thank you, Esme.

306
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,210
Firstly, the bang in the pub
was nothing to do with London.

307
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,650
Understood?

308
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,130
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

309
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,730
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

310
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,420
so long as we stick together.

311
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,610
And after the first few weeks,

312
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,090
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

313
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,570
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

314
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,740
That's right.

315
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,450
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed their reservations.

316
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,730
Fair enough.

317
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,930
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

318
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,460
walk out the door...

319
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,020
..right now.

320
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,140
Go raise your chickens.

321
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,700
For those of you with ambition...

322
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,220
..the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

323
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,170
Tomorrow?

324
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,260
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

325
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,170
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

326
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,770
We have 18 staff.

327
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,170
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

328
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,180
Oh, I changed the combination.

329
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,620
So what's going on, Thomas?

330
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,700
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

331
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,340
Give me the combination, Polly.

332
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,060
Polly, give me the combination!

333
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,370
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

334
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,890
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

335
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,180
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

336
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,580
So why tomorrow?

337
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,610
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

338
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,050
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

339
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,450
What, so you just roll up
and take the city?

340
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,780
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

341
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,890
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

342
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,970
have been at war in London
for six months.

343
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,090
It's not our war.

344
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,730
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

345
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,050
~ Yeah, but we don't.
~ We need a foothold

346
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,170
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

347
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,180
The Jews control Camden Town.

348
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,130
Your mother said,

349
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,460
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

350
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,610
No-one gets killed, Polly.

351
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,010
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

352
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,490
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,010
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

354
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,890
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

355
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,540
Now please, open the fucking safe.

356
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,140
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there...

357
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,780
..about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

358
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,730
But when it comes to it,

359
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,660
you don't listen to a word we say.

360
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,860
Maybe you don't trust us.

361
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,500
She was one woman, Thomas.

362
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,770
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

363
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,530
Forgot about who?

364
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,460
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

365
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,100
Are you going to London now?

366
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,300
No, there's something
I have to do first.

367
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,130
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

368
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,290
I got it out of a catalogue.

369
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,820
I'm doing a correspondence course.

370
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,330
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

371
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,980
It's a test you have to do.

372
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,260
Will you come back before you go?

373
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,100
No.

374
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,810
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

375
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,890
as if we were ordinary people.

376
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,020
Yeah.

377
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,850
Let's begin.

378
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,540
Hands on the table.

379
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,810
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

380
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,020
So, let's welcome them.

381
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,330
Starting with you.

382
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,530
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

383
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,650
My husband.

384
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,250
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

385
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,810
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

386
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,570
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

387
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,500
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

388
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,900
She's an un-sanctified charlatan.

389
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,020
And you?

390
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,540
Who do you seek?

391
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,970
Well, the truth...

392
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,730
Sorry, the truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

393
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,220
So I came here to find out.

394
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,780
Er...

395
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,530
You see, my son and my daughter

396
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,370
were taken from me
when they were very small -

397
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,850
taken by the parish authorities.

398
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,570
And I never knew
what happened to them.

399
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,100
But lately...

400
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,420
I've had a feeling.

401
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,860
Like, a feeling...

402
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,820
I can't put it into words.

403
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,060
And I keep having a dream.

404
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,050
I see a pretty girl,

405
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,740
about 18 years old.

406
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,140
And she's standing
across the street...

407
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,530
..and she tells me
she's passed over.

408
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,580
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

409
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,900
On May 15th.

410
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,980
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

411
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,380
And she shouts...and shouts.

412
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,130
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

413
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,900
because I'm her mother.

414
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,090
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

415
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,060
after they stole her from me.

416
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,740
But if she does want
to say goodbye...

417
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,940
I thought this would be the place.

418
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,650
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

419
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,820
You're Gypsy?

420
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,860
The part of me that dreams is Gypsy.

421
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,820
My maiden name is Shelby.

422
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,740
So...

423
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,500
..perhaps you could do me first.

424
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,420
No!

425
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,540
No!

426
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,940
NO!

427
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,220
No...

00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,810
All right, Tommy's here.

446
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,740
Hang on!

447
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,770
John!

448
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,980
I'm coming!

449
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,010
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

450
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,930
10 if I'm still sober.

451
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,290
I got it from the doctor -

452
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,060
it keeps me nice and calm.

453
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,850
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

454
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,410
to stop us fucking wanking.

455
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,290
Polly said it's good for me temper.

456
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,330
~ It slows me down, Tom. ~ Arthur...

457
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,370
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

458
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,050
I need you fast. Not slow, eh?

459
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,050
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

460
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,530
~ I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of! ~ Right.

461
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,690
You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

462
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,330
Nothing wrong with opinions, John.

463
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,980
~ Get in the fucking car. ~ Shut up!

464
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,970
Right!

465
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,690
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

466
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,180
Sit down, you mad bastard.

467
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,260
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

468
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,090
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

469
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,700
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

470
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,930
She's one of ours.

471
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,860
Anything over £1, tell me.

472
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,980
Polly...

473
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,770
I don't wish to pry
into your business

474
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,650
but you should know something.

475
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,410
That woman is a trickster.

476
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,170
What woman?

477
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,250
Her sister was in
the wash house early,

478
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,980
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

479
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,980
What woman?

480
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,780
Gypsies talk to each other.

481
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,580
What woman?

482
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,060
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

483
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,130
I'm sorry...

484
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,970
So what do you know?

485
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,930
I know they push the glass.

486
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,450
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

487
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,850
It's a trick.

488
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,180
They tell you what
you already believe.

489
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,490
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

490
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,250
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

491
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,050
And in this fucking wash house,

492
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,780
did they tell you why I went there?

493
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,290
You tell a soul in this family,

494
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,300
and I swear I will cut you.

495
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,340
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

496
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,380
It is a matter of honour.

497
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,330
Look at this! Look.

498
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,970
I love it.

499
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,410
Your Esme was right
about one thing -

500
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,530
you can't beat the countryside.

501
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,300
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day...

502
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,850
..and keep chickens.

503
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,420
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

504
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,580
~ Oh, for fuck's sake! ~ Take these.

505
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,490
We need to bury him.

506
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,530
Who the fuck is that?

507
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,010
It's Irish business.

508
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,650
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

509
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,210
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

510
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,010
John, grab his head.

511
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,650
So, we're not really
going to London?

512
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,450
Once we bury him,

513
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,260
then the holiday begins.

514
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,540
Much obliged.

515
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,260
It's a fucking freak show.

516
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,530
What the fuck is that racket?

517
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,700
~ This is what they call music
these days, brother. ~ Music?!

518
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,490
Oi!

519
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,930
Oi! Put it away.

520
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,260
Fuck off!

521
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,410
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

522
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,260
It's all right, isn't it?

523
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,290
Irish whisky - a bottle.

524
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,580
And hurry up!

525
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,450
Fucking hell,

526
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,420
I recognise a few of these lads.

527
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,690
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

528
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,410
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

529
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,810
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

530
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,420
Just the lieutenants, John.
No sign of the officers.

531
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,100
Right, let's line them up.

532
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,500
Holiday!

533
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,530
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

534
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,540
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

535
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,770
We just bought a fucking bottle.

536
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,010
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

537
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,610
Yeah, we get that a lot.

538
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,810
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

539
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,650
without prior agreement.

540
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,900
And what line would that be,
my friend?

541
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,500
They say this is provocation.

542
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,220
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

543
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,820
You're breaking the rules.

544
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,890
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

545
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,500
Peaky scum!

546
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,620
Who the fuck's next?

547
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,140
Come here!

548
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:29,620
Put some ice on 'em!

549
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,300
Get out.

550
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,180
Yeah?

551
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,130
Yeah?

552
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,620
Are you going to use that?

553
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,540
Didn't think so.

554
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,770
We came here...

555
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,820
not to make enemies...

556
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,460
No!

557
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,380
We came here to make new friends.

558
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,570
Those of you who are last

559
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,660
will soon be first.

560
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,170
And those of you who are downtrodden

561
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:36,580
will rise up.

562
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,780
Yip.

563
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,860
You know where to find us.

564
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,490
I think I've lost a tooth.

565
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,940
I'll have none left at this rate!

566
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,850
Some fucking holiday this is.

567
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,490
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

568
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,370
~ Here, this'll fix you. ~ Give me that!

569
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,490
You, John boy...eh? How are you?

570
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,410
~ Or should I ask your fucking wife?
~ Oh, give over!

571
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,810
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

572
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,930
Fuck the chickens.

573
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,570
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

574
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,130
Let's paint the town, eh?

575
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,300
Come.

576
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,050
~ Oh, dear God! ~ Good Lord,
I assumed it was Betty with tea.

577
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,810
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

578
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,290
No, because she takes lunch -
like normal people.

579
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,810
And you can turn around,

580
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,450
this lady is
a professional life model.

581
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,020
She does this for a living.

582
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,210
I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

583
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,100
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the house. Just, erm...

584
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,450
..keep your back turned,
if you must.

585
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,460
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

586
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,450
Well, I...I...play cards on occasion.

587
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:12,250
You're a stranger to cocaine
and exotic dancing, too, I imagine.

588
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,250
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

589
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,980
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

590
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:26,050
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

591
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,050
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

592
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,610
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

593
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,530
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

594
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:37,970
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for the bigger task.

595
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,730
~ Expressions elude me,
I think too much. ~ Sir?

596
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:47,810
I need your authority
to proceed with all urgency

597
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,610
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

598
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,570
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

599
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,650
Yes, sir.

600
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,980
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

601
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,410
To apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

602
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,010
you have to know his weaknesses

603
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,930
and I know this man's weaknesses
intimately.

604
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,090
And after "mission accomplished",

605
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,210
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

606
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,980
Absolutely not, sir.

607
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,770
So when he's served his purpose,

608
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,730
he will be consigned to history

609
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,010
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

610
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,570
You mean at the end of a rope?

611
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,050
Well, the end of the rope

612
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:34,300
has been this man's destiny
since the night he was born.

613
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,900
You're early.

614
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,410
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

615
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,730
What?

616
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,660
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

617
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,650
Good.

618
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,330
Now, come with me.

619
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,850
No, shut your eyes!

620
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,170
~ This way. ~ What are you doing, Tom?

621
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,420
You've got to sit down
here. Right...

622
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,570
Sit down. Now, OK...

623
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,770
~ Type this. ~ Why?

624
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,290
Lizzie, type this.

625
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,930
"If wi..." Put your cigarette down.

626
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,850
Right. "If winter comes..."

627
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,530
"..then can spring be far behind?"

628
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,890
Why?! Did you say spring?

629
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,660
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

630
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,410
Let's see.

631
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:56,690
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

632
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,050
Put in the question mark.

633
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,970
Now type this.

634
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,330
"Wanted - secretary
for expanding business."

635
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,730
Slow down!

636
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,380
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch-type."

637
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,610
"Five days a week.

638
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,050
"Eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

639
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,420
"Must be able to start immediately."

640
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,140
Are you serious?

641
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,100
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

642
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,860
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

643
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,020
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

644
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
All of it this time.

645
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,340
No exceptions.

646
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,690
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

647
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,820
Don't be late.

648
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,890
Newmarket was profitable.

649
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,850
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

650
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,490
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

651
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,530
he said you poured it away.

652
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,650
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

653
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,170
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

654
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,010
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

655
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,450
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

656
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,490
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

657
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,300
~ Stop fucking fighting me!
~ Somebody has to.

658
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,370
That arrived an hour ago.

659
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,010
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

660
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,410
I was going to burn it.

661
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,850
I should have.

662
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,130
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

663
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,020
Now you're at war with Sabini.

664
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,370
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

665
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,130
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

666
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,740
She goes mad if I'm late!

667
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,290
Ada Shelby?

668
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,460
No.

669
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,690
Your brother broke the rules.

670
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,210
I don't have a fucking brother.

671
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,730
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

672
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,330
~ Let's go for a drive. ~ No!

673
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,780
~ Hold her steady, boys. ~ Get off!

674
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,860
Fucking hold him!

675
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,890
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

676
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,130
I was at the races.

677
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,700
Sabini.

678
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,660
Don't say my name.

679
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,610
Jesus!

680
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,620
Franco,
take my name out of his mouth.

681
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,450
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

682
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,610
Pay for the petrol.

683
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,610
You see how much I know about you?

684
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,340
I even know what's in
your fucking mouth.

685
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,730
Look at me.

686
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,410
Look at me!

687
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,700
Look at me.

688
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,370
You take up with the Jews.

689
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,890
Yeah, you think that's
what London's all about.

690
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,290
You can just come down,
pick a side.

691
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,850
You fucking clown!

692
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,660
Now your life is over.

693
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:29,770
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

694
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,450
Your mistake.

695
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,580
You remember that
when you get to hell.

696
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,540
Finish him off.

697
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,860
I suppose we should
see if the bastard's still alive.
