1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,680
I just got served a black hand.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,920
Everybody will have got one.
They're coming for us all.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,520
These men will not leave our city
until our whole family is dead.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,680
This was all my fault. It was me that shot
the old man. John's dead because of me.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:17,540
Within a four-mile radius of the Garrison,
every man is a guard and a soldier for us.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,300
We're going back, back to Small Heath.
That's how it works.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,540
An eye for an eye.
It's called a vendetta.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,100
We are an organization...

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,500
run different, I imagine.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,700
None of you will survive.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,300
And how is Tommy Shelby OBE going
to stop a revolution?

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,820
If I get Jessie Eden's trust,

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,900
she gives me the names of the instigators,
and I give them up to the Crown forces.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,500
I want you to help my son achieve
his ambition.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,100
You're a Peaky Blinder now, son.

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,740
We control him on the book, control
the odds.

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,460
We've got a lot going on though,
Tom.

18
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,500
That's why it'll be good to have
the kid around.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,140
Mr Shelby will give you a 20% cut

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,860
if you put Goliath down in the
fourth round.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,300
So you're going to take my boys, and you're
going to bring them to the ring as seconds?

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,580
Yeah, Tommy Shelby was right about
you, wasn't he?

23
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,420
Yeah, you're like me, Tommy.

24
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,460
You can't bear to watch a fight
which has got rules.

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,180
Tommy, imagine...

26
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,140
imagine that you could not see at
all,

27
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,100
you was born blind.

28
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,300
Then, one day,

29
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,980
you open up your eyes

30
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,020
and you can see everything in the
world...

31
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,060
..when before you could only touch
it or smell it.

32
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,460
There it is the revelation, innit?

33
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,740
I've had one.

34
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,740
Yeah, I saw a beautiful house down
in Margate.

35
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,300
A great big white building. Monkey
puzzle tree against the sky blue.

36
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,540
Beautiful. A piece of heaven,
actually.

37
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,660
You can see the way the Earth
curves, and I thought to myself,

38
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,780
Alfie, you know, what...what are you
doing? What are you doing?

39
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,260
Why don't you just sell every ounce
of gold

40
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,820
and sell every barrel of rum you got
and just buy yourself some time, mate?

41
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,220
I need to buy myself some time.

42
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,580
You're moving to Margate?

43
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,860
I am, actually, yeah.
I need to get myself some rest.

44
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,900
I need some rest.

45
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,420
Plus, the Americans are here now,
aren't they?

46
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,020
So, well, that's it, yeah.

47
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,060
It's been that way ever since
the war, innit, the Americans?

48
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,820
Big fucks small...

49
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,540
..always, actually.

50
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,500
There is a fight going on out there
between big and small.

51
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,700
Big will fuck small.

52
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,300
Right! Margate, then. Blue skies,
heaven.

53
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,740
I will see you, Tommy, by the pier.

54
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,220
Stay and watch the fight, Alfie.

55
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,940
No, you're all right. I already
know who wins, don't I?

56
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,300
Ta-ra!

57
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Round one.

58
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,220
Fight, you bastard!

59
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,060
Bonnie... Bonnie.

60
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,180
Don't you touch it, Charlie.

61
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,460
I know he's a big bastard, but you
got to...

62
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,660
Where's Solomons?
Apparently he doesn't watch.

63
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,500
Look at that corner, look. The men
there, they don't know fighters.

64
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,060
I don't like it... You feel it
though, Tom, don't you?

65
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,300
I feel it. We're all right. We're
surrounded by soldiers, Arthur.

66
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Alfie's men were strip-searched,
we're all right.

67
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,940
Right, come on, gypsy boy, let's
go.

68
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,740
So what did Tommy say when you
told him?

69
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,980
He said I'll get a weekly
allowance.

70
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,860
Oh, he can be romantic.

71
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,420
Of course, as company treasurer, I
shall be questioning that expense.

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,700
He said something like, "We've had
enough death, let's have some life."

73
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,260
Pol, this fight is fixed, isn't
it?

74
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,300
Well, gypsy boy's getting battered
out there.

75
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,540
Right, you said you had some news?

76
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,420
Lizzie has some news.

77
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,820
Polly!

78
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,660
Well, tell her. Now! While the men
are screaming for blood.

79
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,300
Have a swig, you're going to need
it.

80
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,220
I'm up the duff.

81
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,260
And it's Tommy's.

82
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,340
How far gone are you?

83
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,540
If I were going to London I'd be
in Coventry.

84
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,340
And are you carrying on past
Coventry?

85
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,020
All the way to fucking Piccadilly
Circus.

86
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,380
Have you found whether she's
having a boy or a girl, Pol?

87
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,540
No.
Go on, then.

88
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,620
It's a girl.

89
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,860
Call her Ruby. Ruby Shelby.

90
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,780
She'll be a star in a Hollywood
movie.

91
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,220
Congratulations.

92
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,500
Hello, Linda. Welcome to
extraordinary general meeting

93
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,300
of the Shelby ladies club.

94
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,860
Is there spit on my back?

95
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,260
There are men out there spitting -
it's fucking disgusting.

96
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,820
No. There's no spit on your back.

97
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,780
Don't let us stop you doing what you
came in to do.

98
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,820
What?

99
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,740
It's helping me get through the
fucking nightmare of being

100
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,340
stuck in the city.

101
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,340
Well, since you're here and you're
almost family,

102
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,940
Lizzie's got some news.

103
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
I'm pregnant.

104
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,020
Oh. And who's the father? Have you
managed to narrow it down?

105
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,100
Yes. It's Tommy.

106
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,140
Congratulations. You've won the
raffle at last.

107
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:46,700
Yeah, she's a real Shelby lady
now, Linda. Just like you.

108
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Right, ladies, lets rejoin our
gentlemen.

109
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,460
And just remember, Linda, if they
spit, just spit back.

110
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,420
I'll see you out there.

111
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,060
All right.

112
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,660
Come on, Bonnie!

113
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,700
Right, you Brummie boys!

114
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,660
Forget your loyalty, boys!

115
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,060
You're still in control, Bonnie?

116
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,700
Yes.

117
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,060
Then take him.

118
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,980
It's not too late, boys.

119
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,900
I'll give you 2 to 1 on the big
Cockney, Goliath here.

120
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,980
Take it or leave it, boys.

121
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,380
Take it or leave it, boys. 2 to 1.

122
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,420
2 to 1 on the Cockney giant.

123
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,700
Look at them men in his corner,
look.

124
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,820
They don't know fighters.

125
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,980
They don't know the fucking ropes.

126
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,540
It's the pills and the booze
spooking you, Arthur.

127
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,380
Look at them. They don't stand
right, they don't move right.

128
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,540
They don't even care if he fucking
wins.

129
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,380
It's the fucking pills, brother,
all right?

130
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,500
Whoooo!

131
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,540
What the fuck are they laughing
about?

132
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,340
It's that new batch...too strong.

133
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,860
Come on, Bonnie!
Come on, Bonnie!

134
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,420
Arthur, leave it!

135
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Where's he going?
Sit down and watch the fight, eh?

136
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,300
Arthur! Come here!

137
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
Let me do my fucking job.

138
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,180
Bonnie! Bonnie! Are you OK?

139
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll give you two to one now on
the Cockney!

140
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,620
Take it while you can.

141
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,740
Right...

142
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,860
Come on, Bonnie Boy! Bonnie, come
on. Get him!

143
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,780
Where are Tommy and Arthur?

144
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,500
I don't know.

145
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Go on, Bonnie.

146
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,620
Go on, hit him!

147
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,940
Arthur?!

148
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,660
You fucking bastard!

149
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,780
Arthur?!

150
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,140
I declare Bonnie Gold

151
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,780
the new welterweight champion of the
Midlands,

152
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,300
the south and the Home Counties.

153
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,820
Yes!

154
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,540
Tommy, what's happened?

155
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,140
Arthur's dead. He's dead.

156
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,660
Tommy, we have the other wop.

157
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,620
The cunt had a wire in his pocket.

158
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,100
Go on, Finn!

159
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,940
Go on, Finn.

160
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,420
Take his eyes, Finn. Do it for
Arthur.

161
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Take his fucking eyes!

162
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,940
GROANING

163
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,100
GROANING

164
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,620
Close the doors! No-one fucking
leaves!

165
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,700
My brother is dead.

166
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,180
Do you hear me?!

167
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,220
My brother is dead!

168
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,220
Tommy. Tommy.

169
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,460
Fuck off.

170
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,860
Tommy. Tom. Tom. Tommy.

171
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,900
Hello, Michael. There's been a
change of plan.

172
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,740
Mr Gold will come and get you.

173
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,420
Arthur's dead.

174
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,700
Tommy, I've been trying to think
of words.

175
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,940
Don't.

176
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,420
Words don't work.

177
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,780
Michael, we're in a grave situation.
Tommy has a plan.

178
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,620
Instead of going to Australia,
you're going to New York.

179
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,620
Why?

180
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,940
Because the company has business
to attend to in America.

181
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,700
Will I be coming back?

182
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,700
Your train leaves in an hour,
Michael.

183
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,380
You made a choice.

184
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,020
You knew I was going to be shot and
you chose not to tell me.

185
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,660
I chose my mum.

186
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:05,380
When all this business is over we'll
all be free to make our own choices.

187
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,420
So that's it?

188
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,500
You get the train to Liverpool
then the SS Monroe.

189
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,060
The boat sails tomorrow.

190
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,380
Now you can go.

191
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,060
I need an overseas connection,
please.

192
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,700
USA.

193
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,620
Tommy!

194
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,100
It's all right, let her come!

195
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,500
Please...until we're finished.

196
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,860
Your note talked about making
terms for peace.

197
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,260
But my son says there are no terms.

198
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,220
You took my husband and my son.

199
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,700
We took two of your brothers.

200
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,620
The vendetta is done.

201
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,940
We say the vendetta is won.

202
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,180
We will take everything you have.

203
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,620
All your businesses, signed over to
us.

204
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,380
You agree to this or my son will
kill you all.

205
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,460
One by one.

206
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,940
The vendetta is won. That's it.

207
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
No more killing.

208
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,660
Who did you think you were, Mr
Shelby?

209
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,940
Make sure he knows we're here to
buy his business!

210
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,860
Mr Solomons!

211
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,100
Mr Changretta is here to see you.

212
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,220
They say he was a captain.

213
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,180
Ah. I think you might want to tell
them not to open that fucking door.

214
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,060
It seems Mr Solomons has already
left town.

215
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,420
So all this is mine.

216
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,900
You don't knock?

217
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,860
You don't know my new address?

218
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,220
Hello, Lizzie, how are you?

219
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,580
I know your new address, Lizzie,

220
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,860
because it was me who bought you the
new fucking house.

221
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,540
Then why don't you visit it?

222
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,700
I've been busy.

223
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,460
Busy doing what?

224
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,300
Preparing for tomorrow.

225
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,140
Why? What's tomorrow?

226
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,020
Luca Changretta is coming to
Birmingham. It's our turn.

227
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,940
He's already taken over Alfie
Solomons, Sabini, the Titanics.

228
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,420
All of them.

229
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,500
And now he's coming to take
control of Shelby Company Limited.

230
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,580
What are we going to do about
that?

231
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,940
We're going to let him have it.

232
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,020
All that's left of the Peaky
fucking Blinders.

233
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,540
I've had my lawyer draw up these
papers.

234
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,620
They cover, er, every enterprise in
your possession.

235
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,060
Bars, restaurants, warehouses...

236
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,740
..every fucking thing that you've

237
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,060
taken all these years to gather
together.

238
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,100
You will sign them all over to my
family.

239
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,740
Or you're going to die, right here.

240
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,620
I would have buried you all.

241
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,980
But my mother, she, er, she knows
you.

242
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,300
She said it'll be worse for you

243
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,220
if I let you live...

244
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,940
..and take away everything that you
have.

245
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,540
Search 'em...

246
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,940
Especially don't trust this bitch.

247
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,540
So...

248
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,620
Sign.

249
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Every fucking one of 'em.

250
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,540
You can sign them on your knees...

251
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,860
on the floor.

252
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,700
Get on your fucking knees and sign!

253
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,100
As a friend of mine once said...

254
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
..big fucks small.

255
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,700
So I had to find someone bigger than
you.

256
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,260
Now, you may know there are two
families in Brooklyn who want

257
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,740
to take over your monopoly on the
import of liquor into New York.

258
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,620
But if they moved against you in
New York they'll start

259
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,380
a war between the families.

260
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,260
But if you were to die in a
vendetta

261
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,980
with some fucking bookmaker in
Birmingham,

262
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,900
they could take over your business
without a war...

263
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,980
We also contacted a businessman in
Chicago.

264
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,100
He's also interested in moving into
the liquor business in New York.

265
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,780
His name is Alphonse Capone.

266
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,820
You been talking to that fat fuck?

267
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,380
See, all the blood relatives you
brought with

268
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,700
you from New York, they're all dead,
Mr Changretta.

269
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,860
And these men here, they work for
money, for the highest bidder.

270
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,700
They now have new orders.

271
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,220
Is that right?

272
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,300
Is that right?

273
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,420
Daniel?

274
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,580
Matteo?

275
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,500
Hey...

276
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,180
Very fucking...

277
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,420
Arthur's been injured but he's all
right, Pol.

278
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,260
We need to make them believe that
he's dead...

279
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,740
..to everyone but you, me and
Linda...

280
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,860
Arthur Shelby is dead.

281
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,940
I've got it all worked out.

282
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,500
We can use his death to win this
war.

283
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,700
Tell your people in Chicago that
Michael Gray will sign

284
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,420
the import licence to New York.

285
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,140
300 barrels of English Dry Gin a
month.

286
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,620
Leave! All of you.

287
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,540
Tell your boss what you saw here
today.

288
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,780
And tell him...

289
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,140
..you don't fuck with the Peaky
Blinders.

290
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,020
Right. Oi! Listen up.

291
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,540
Before we all go and eat, I'd like
to say a few words.

292
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,020
The last time we were all here, it
ended badly.

293
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,300
Yeah.

294
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,100
But now we're in a happier place.

295
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,940
That's it.

296
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,940
I'd just like to raise a toast...

297
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,900
Hold on.

298
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,820
A few words I'd like to say from the
heart,

299
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,020
and this time you're going to let me
finish, Tommy.

300
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,940
Now as you all know, Arthur Shelby
is dead.

301
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,820
Because of that, Tommy's offered me
a way out.

302
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,020
A new identity.

303
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,380
Start a whole new life for myself.

304
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,540
And I've thought about it.

305
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,220
Made a decision.

306
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,700
I ain't fucking going nowhere.

307
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,300
Our enemies are gone. Dead, all of
'em.

308
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:29,740
For the first time since me and my
two kid brothers...

309
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,500
Tommy and John...

310
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,380
..enlisted in the Warwickshire
Yeomanry, we have peace.

311
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,260
So, I think I'd like to make a
proposal.

312
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,620
All of you, the Shelby Company
Limited, insist that Tommy

313
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,580
here takes some time off.

314
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,060
It's time you took a holiday, Tom.
Put your feet up.

315
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,900
War is over. No-one wants to kill
us.

316
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,100
To peace.

317
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,340
To peace.

318
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,980
I do hope you're going to leave
the dog out of this?

319
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,500
You were easy to find.

320
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,020
Yeah. There's a good reason for
that, Tommy.

321
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,140
I wanted it to be here.

322
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,260
I once told you, Alfie, for
business reasons or in bad blood,

323
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,100
I will kill you.

324
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,220
I have no business reasons. It seems
you have retired.

325
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,500
So this is all purely for bad
blood, is it, Tommy?

326
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Yeah.
Right, yeah.

327
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,660
I told you I wanted it to be here.

328
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,740
Are you going to look after this
dog?

329
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,820
No.
Right, then. Well, his name is Cyril.

330
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,340
He'll be very upset and distressed,
so you'll need to find him someone.

331
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,820
You're not armed?

332
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,900
No! Don't be daft.

333
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,020
The only thing I've got on me...

334
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,380
is fucking cancer, mate.

335
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,260
Yeah.

336
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,060
Riddled with it.

337
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,580
Doctor told me

338
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,860
I might have picked it up in France
in a gas or something.

339
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,820
He even showed me a photograph of it, before I met you at the fight.
Alfie, stop talking.

340
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,220
So I said, Margate, right, and here I am. Come on, Tommy.
Alfie, look at me.

341
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,700
There's an honourable reason
now to pull that trigger.

342
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,980
Alfie, look at me.
So what you waiting for?

343
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,700
Just fucking get on with it, and
stop acting like a little girl.

344
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,340
Alfie!
Do you want me to do it for you?

345
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,460
Mr Shelby?

346
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,900
Mr Shelby?

347
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,020
Mr Shelby?

348
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,860
Mr Shelby, you are not yourself, I
should call a doctor.

349
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,620
It's all right, Frances.

350
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,380
I'll call Mrs Grey.

351
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,100
I know what this is.

352
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,220
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

353
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,780
Right... Thank you.

354
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,180
Charlie...

355
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,940
Since I know you
won't go yourself,

356
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,300
I've been to a doctor
on your behalf.

357
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,700
No, it's all right. None of
the boys know you're sick.

358
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm not sick, Polly.

359
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,700
It starts when you stop.
When you rest.

360
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,060
Could be nerves, the war.

361
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,100
Might be the alcohol.

362
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,740
The blue devils, they call that.

363
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,420
Yeah, well. Yeah. Yeah,
it's the fucking booze.

364
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,900
It's the booze, the booze got hold
and the booze got in my bones.

365
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,260
Lizzie wants to see you.

366
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,020
No...

367
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,620
Tom, she's showing.

368
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,220
I don't want to see Lizzie, Pol.

369
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,340
Shit, maybe it's in us?

370
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,820
It's us Shelbys.

371
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,060
It's in our gypsy blood.

372
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,580
We live somewhere between life and
death.

373
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,540
Waiting to move on.

374
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,860
And in the end...we accept it.

375
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,020
We shake hands with the devils and
we walk past them.

376
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,140
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be
resting.

377
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,500
I have learnt something, Frances.

378
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,140
There is no rest for me in this
world.

379
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,340
Perhaps in the next.

380
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,220
Them there you pay out. This one
you have to think.

381
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:13,540
Use your fucking head, man. Right,
even money...

382
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,580
Whose fucking idea was it that I
go on holiday?

383
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,020
Welcome back, Tommy. How was it?

384
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,060
What did you get up to?

385
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,500
Went fishing. Played golf.

386
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,780
Golf's fucking boring.

387
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,940
Yeah, boring and easy.

388
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,460
Yeah, well, what's the plan?

389
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,900
I need you to give this to Jesse
Eden, by hand.

390
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,940
Yes, Mr Shelby.

391
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,180
By your hand. This will be the
last job you'll do for me.

392
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,500
Go to Glasgow and be with your
family. You're free.

393
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,020
You need to sign all of these.

394
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,420
So you shook hands with the devil?

395
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:17,980
Yeah, and I walked past him.

396
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,260
Pol.

397
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,860
I've had an idea.

398
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,500
Oh, fuck.

399
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,660
"Dear Jessie. Now more certainly
than ever

400
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,860
"I believe things must change.

401
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,180
"Things MUST change.

402
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,580
"The general strike is holding,
we've not an hour to lose.

403
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,740
"Meet me."

404
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,260
I've made up my mind, Jessie.
About what?

405
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,860
Your cause is now my cause. I want
to help.

406
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,460
The strike is holding.

407
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,820
I want to meet the people who can
take this further.

408
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,460
Are you serious?

409
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,060
Yeah, I've done a lot of thinking.

410
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,220
Right. I'll arrange a meeting.

411
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,460
The operator knows my voice. Give
me the name and the number.

412
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,780
His name is Casey Douglas.

413
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,820
Sparkhill 453.

414
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,900
Right.

415
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,660
And he's the leader of the cell?

416
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,340
He's in contact with London and
Moscow.

417
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,340
Good.

418
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,780
Yeah, Sparkhill 453.

419
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,460
You are quite a creature, Mr
Shelby.

420
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,060
When I received your note, I wasn't
sure you could deliver.

421
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,020
I have made contact with

422
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,100
the Soviet agent inside the
Birmingham Communist Party.

423
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,660
And you have a name?

424
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:38,900
And an address and a telephone
number.

425
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,860
I can be of great use to you.

426
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,180
I can give you the names of any
Communist Party member who is

427
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:53,380
prepared to cross the line into
armed revolution.

428
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,620
We are in the fourth day of a
general strike which appears

429
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,660
to be holding.

430
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:01,660
Even if it fails today...

431
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,140
tomorrow, they may succeed.

432
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,820
Mm.

433
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,940
And you're offering to help ensure
they never succeed.

434
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,740
If my cover is maintained...

435
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,300
..I can begin to shape the movement,
organise it myself...

436
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,700
And undermine it.

437
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,740
Rise through the ranks of the
wider socialist movement.

438
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,100
But, of course, you want something
in return. What this time?

439
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,220
A knighthood?

440
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,540
My proposal.

441
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,780
And my conditions.

442
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,820
For the attention of Winston
Churchill.

443
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,780
He holds me in very high regard.

444
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,380
Are you serious?

445
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,340
Breaking up a revolutionary cell
is one thing.

446
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,300
Given my position of influence in my
home city,

447
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,780
I can be of much more use to you
than that.

448
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,300
Ronald Carr, Conservative, 3,412

449
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,180
Bernard Hall, Liberal, 4,015.

450
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,060
Michael Ross, Communist, 6,406.

451
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,580
Thomas Shelby, Labour Party, 48,564.

452
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,020
I now declare Thomas Shelby to be
the new

453
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,460
Labour Member of Parliament for the
constituency of Birmingham South.
