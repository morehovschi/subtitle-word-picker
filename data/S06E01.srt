﻿1
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:06,895
The man we're about to meet is the
devil.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,135
My name's Mosley. Oswald Mosley.

3
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:10,915
You've come to my attention.

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:12,478
Michael Gray.

5
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:15,415
You lost all your cousin's money in
America, playing the fool.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,696
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,920
His wife, she's been seen
with another man.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,056
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,296
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,376
I want to meet your family.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,480
No, you don't.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,576
Mr Thomas, it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,496
£250,000.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,936
All we have to do is keep it here
for a week.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,296
I vote against it, Tom.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,896
Those in favour?

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,080
Motion carried.

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,216
We're talking about an empty chair,
Ada. My chair. My throne.

19
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,536
Someone wants my crown.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,856
I think it might be Michael.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,216
Mr Shelby, my name is Captain Swing.

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,776
Michael, your kin, was making deals

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,096
with the very men who want you dead.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,040
It's time.

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,200
And you know it.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,520
Let me guess...

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,336
...don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,816
There will be a war
and one of you will die,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,696
but which one I cannot tell.

31
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,536
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,896
Kill... and kill.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,136
I have a job for you.

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm going to shoot Oswald Mosley.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,600
Kill the man, kill the message.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,896
I think it's about time we
got off the stage, old man.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,416
The Chinese, the Italians.

38
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,816
Mosley knew nothing!

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,776
He knew nothing!

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,240
Who?!

41

42
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,520
Talk to me.

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Maybe I've found him...

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,040
...Arthur, the man I can't defeat.

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,776
- Mosley.
- I don't know.

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,520
I don't fucking know.

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,080
Doesn't make sense.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,896
Let's...

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's go inside.

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,576
We'll work it out, have a drink.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
I need to walk.

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,416
The work's all done, Tommy.

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,096
It's all done.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
We can walk away from all of this.

55
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,136
It's so easy. It's so soft.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,880
Such a small change.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,360
Arthur took the bullets out.

58
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,880
On the way back.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,800
He said you stopped at
a crossroads to throw up.

60
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,880
You're not even a soldier any more,
Tommy.

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,680
You didn't check your weapon.

62
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,980
You're not a soldier, you're a coward.

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,040
I heard you pull the trigger.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,960
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye...

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
If you still need a way out...

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
...here are six of them.

67
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:49,306
Mother.

68
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:53,746
They let you pass through.

69
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
They wouldn't let me pass.

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,360
As if there were to be
another consequence.

71
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,296
Hello?

72
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,216
Mr Shelby, I imagine you're curious
as to who it was prevented

73
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,936
the assassination last night.

74
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,016
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

75
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,536
It's a unit of volunteers bringing
the bodies of your dead to you

76
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
to send to heaven in your own way.

77
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,656
Last night's operation was carried
out by soldiers from three

78
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,040
Dublin brigades of the
Irish Republican Army.

79
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,700
We need to keep Mr Mosley alive.

80
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,480
That's all you need to know.

81
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,176
Also, you should know that saving

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Mosley's life wasn't our only
intervention last night.

83
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,080
We've made some changes to the
structure of your organisation.

84
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,740
Ever since you began
to build your empire...

85
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,640
...you've had a crutch to lean on.

86
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,540
Last night, we kicked away that crutch.

87
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.

88
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,060
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people...

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,600
...are your own responsibility...

90
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
...because you consistently fail to
understand your own limitations.

91
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
Mum...

92
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,856
...it was the ambitions and strategies

93
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,280
of one man that caused this.

94
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,320
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God...

95
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,216
...no matter what it takes...

96
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
...no matter how many lies I have
to tell...

97
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,520
...I will take revenge on Tommy Shelby.

98
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:55,280
_

99
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,520
Monsieur.

100
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,280
Monsieur!

101
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,153
_

102
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,520
_

103
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,400
_

104
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,200
_

105
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,135
_

106
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,000
_

107
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,810
_

108
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,760
You want a drink?

109
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,440
I'll have a glass of water, please.

110
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,080
Windows got broke because a lot of
people here are drunk and angry.

111
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,360
You know?

112
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,736
Half the men on this island
made their living

113
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,896
bootlegging till today.

114
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,880
The other half fixed their boats.

115
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,025
_

116
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,800
Maybe you should take your water
into the hall.

117
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,511
_

118
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,840
_

119
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,520
_

120
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,648
_

121
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:38,903
_

122
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,200
I learned a lot of things in France.

123
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,760
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

124
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
Closing our warehouses down.

125
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
Throwing men out of work.

126
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,393
_

127
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,600
Ten years our boat ran whisky down
the President Roads to Boston.

128
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,120
Now we have fucking nothing.

129
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,820
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

130
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,696
Is that meant to be a joke?

131
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,760
No.

132
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,980
I ordered water because I no
longer drink alcohol of any kind.

133
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
_

134
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,096
You, my friend, are
going to drink a toast.

135
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,856
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

136
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,820
whose lives you bastards have destroyed.

137
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,856
Drink it.

138
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,280
Hey.

139
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Drink.

140
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,336
You're not leaving this bar
until you have raised

141
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,080
a toast to the people of Miquelon.

142
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,200
OK.

143
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,320
OK.

144
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,880
I understand that, today of
all days, you would be angry.

145
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,096
But if you had read my card
instead of burning it,

146
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,576
you would realise that this
is a misunderstanding.

147
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,256
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

148
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,976
but you need to sit down
and let me read my newspaper.

149
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,800
Il est bon lui, hein?

150
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,976
Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

151
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,616
I will not drink your toast

152
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,776
cos four years ago, I forswore alcohol.

153
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,840
Putain.

154
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,440
No.

155
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,880
Don't.

156
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,216
Since I foreswore alcohol,

157
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,440
I've become a calmer
and more peaceful person.

158
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:18,564
_

159
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,216
Get in.

160
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,480
Sometimes, in moments
of personal conflict...

161
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,576
...I can resort to my old ways.

162
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,976
If this were to happen now,

163
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,320
it would indeed be a black day in
Miquelon.

164
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,896
Now, my guests will be arriving shortly.

165
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,416
I need to prepare the room.

166
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
Can you show me where?

167
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,456
Excusez-moi. Ou est L'Hotel Robert?

168
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,500
They think we're distillery men
here to take our whisky back.

169
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,220
We're late. He's always early. Let's go.

170
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,056
There will be a war
and one of you will die.

171
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,000
But which one I cannot tell.

172
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,560
Hello, Tommy.

173
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,536
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

174
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,416
That was a misunderstanding.

175
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,600
Hello, Michael.

176
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,616
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

177
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,820
Oh, yeah?

178
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,520
What do you think?

179
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,576
Since my mother passed
away four years ago,

180
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,780
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

181
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,056
Well, we've both been very busy.

182
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,016
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

183
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,856
You know, Michael, when you're
dealing with a very powerful enemy,

184
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,080
taking revenge sometimes requires time.

185
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,491
You have to... pick your moment.

186
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,160
That moment will come.

187
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,620
But now we have a business
interest in common

188
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,652
and any bad blood will be diluted by
time

189
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,480
and a practical self-interest.

190
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,136
Well, Tommy, we're all keen to
hear what you have to say.

191
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,536
I'm very much looking forward
to working with you again, Michael.

192
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,020
You look very well.

193
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,180
You too.

194
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,616
How is the family?

195
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,936
Yeee-haaa!

196
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,856
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin

197
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,736
and he sent it all
the way from Hollywood.

198
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,536
Now sit down and watch the film.

199
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,376
Oh, God. No, Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

200
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,736
don't do that, you're going to hurt
yourself.

201
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,856
Yes, hi. Is that the Bell Tavern?

202
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,896
If there's a gypsy in there called
Johnny Dogs, can you tell him

203
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,416
to come and round up his fucking kids?

204
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,860
It's Christmas. A time for family.

205
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,280
Mum, I was watching that.

206
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,160
OK, everyone, OK.

207
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,656
We're having this Christmas party early

208
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,223
because tomorrow,

209
00:25:43,247 --> 00:25:46,742
me and Charles and Ruby are
going on a big ship to Canada,

210
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:49,176
to be with their daddy.

211
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,220
But we told Father Christmas
about the party...

212
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,363
...and he has brought you all presents.

213
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,388
Oh!

214
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:56,487
Yes!

215
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,791
Race ya!

216
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:01,056
Ada, where the fuck is Father Christmas?

217
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,656
I don't know.
He was supposed to be here by now.

218
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,580
- Yeah.
- Where the fuck are you, Santa?

219
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,296
Ohhh! Ohhh!

220
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,936
Ugggh!

221
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,296
No!

222
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,336
Ugggh!

223
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,660
You've got me!

224
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,400
I've got a gun. You'd better run!

225
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,280
You'd better run!

226
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,380
Gentlemen, today is the
last day of prohibition.

227
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,296
But rather than see it as the
end of something, I believe that,

228
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,496
for men like us, it can present...
a new beginning.

229
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,496
A new opportunity.

230
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,840
An opportunity I would like to share
with people I know I can trust.

231
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,776
For the last 12 years,
the men of this island have been

232
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,776
making their living from bootlegging
whisky,

233
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,136
from navigating the waters

234
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,616
and avoiding American border patrols.

235
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,656
But now that whisky is
about to become legal,

236
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,856
the trade will fall back into the
hands of capitalists from New York,

237
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,896
Boston and Toronto.

238
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,960
But...

239
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
...when one door closes...

240
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,296
...another one opens.

241
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,196
We can take advantage of the systems

242
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,096
that are in place on Miquelon Island

243
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,376
and offer selected boat crews the
opportunity to carry on working.

244
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,200
But this time with a different cargo.

245
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,980
You want me to pour?

246
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,439
No.

247
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,576
Now it's all over the fucking island.

248
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,056
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions,

249
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,496
just a load of fucking boats

250
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,820
with nothing to carry and nowhere to go.

251
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,576
The reason why Miquelon was used
to run whisky in the first place

252
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,976
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

253
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,856
of both America and Canada.

254
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,456
Technically, it's French territory.

255
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,240
The FBI, the RCMP have no jurisdiction.

256
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,296
Where do you get this stuff?

257
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,016
I have established a supply
chain over the last four years

258
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,100
with associates in Belfast.

259
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,136
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

260
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,200
That, my friend, is the
finest opium in the world.

261
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Delivered to my warehouse in
Liverpool directly from Shanghai.

262
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,736
Michael, when it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

263
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,580
I trust him.

264
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,376
What about the French police?

265
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,776
I have been in communication with
the Miquelon Prefet des Gendarmes.

266
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,180
We fought in two of the
same battles in France.

267
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,776
We consider each other comrades.

268
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,696
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

269
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,416
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

270
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,420
We will have to take your proposal
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

271
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,816
Perhaps we can meet after you've
spoken with Uncle Jack, Michael,

272
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,816
who I believe is your wife's uncle,
Jack Nelson.

273
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,376
Hey! Ha-ha!

274
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,736
The guy knows things
that can get him killed

275
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,646
and he says them out loud.

276
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,512
I have a high regard for Mr Nelson.

277
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,456
He has a history not unlike my own.

278
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,376
Jack Nelson's past is forgotten.

279
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,216
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

280
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,320
No, not gone, just erased from
the records, like my own.

281
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,840
Give him my regards, will ya?

282
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,440
You haven't touched your drink, Tom.

283
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,600
You know, since we last met, Michael...

284
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,640
...well, I've become a better man.

285
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,656
I now realise that whisky is just
fuel for the loud engines

286
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,896
inside your head.

287
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,480
Catch yourself on!

288
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,336
What is this guy, a fuckin' poet? Eh?

289
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,480
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

290
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,456
They say the fog is going to get worse.

291
00:30:21,973 --> 00:30:24,773
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

292
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,896
Just understand.

293
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,256
Uncle Jack decides everything, OK?

294
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,776
And I decide when a meeting is over.

295
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,680
So sit down till I say.

296
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,520
Maith fear.

297
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,900
Put some fuckin' hair on your chest,
huh?

298
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,256
Good boy.

299
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,800
Now, give us all a poem before we go.

300
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,760
Want to hear a poem?

301
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,320
Want to hear a poem?

302
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,380
What about you, Brainbox?

303
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,536
I was angry with my friend

304
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,760
I told my wrath, my wrath did end

305
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,120
I was angry with my foe

306
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,560
I told it not...

307
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,520
...my wrath did grow.

308
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,576
It's from The Poison Tree
by William Blake.

309
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,000
You won't have heard of him.

310
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
Meeting over.

311
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,740
Oh, and by the way,

312
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,656
my friend, the Police Commissioner,
told me that he'd spoken

313
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,296
to his FBI liaison officer,

314
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,776
and he told him that there is
an informant in your organisation

315
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,376
in South Boston.

316
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,080
I tell you this in the
spirit of corporate hygiene.

317
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,720
Here you are, Michael.

318
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,616
Beware the man with
a bleeding heart tattoo

319
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,760
with "Maria" written in red.

320
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,100
Have a good day, gentlemen.

321
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,520
This time, don't burn it.

322
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,623
_

323
00:33:56,313 --> 00:33:57,673
Arthur...

324
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,216
Come on, come on.

325
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,280
Tch, God.

326
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,136
Oh, God, if Polly was still here,

327
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,136
she'd never have let it get this bad.

328
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,856
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

329
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,220
Arthur!

330
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,216
I am not Polly,
but I am still your fucking sister.

331
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,840
You swore to me you would stop using.

332
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,056
It's Christmas Day, Ada. Christmas Day.

333
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,776
Yes, it's Christmas.

334
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,896
So where the fuck are
the fucking presents?

335
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,456
I'll be all right in a bit...

336
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,776
Great.

337
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,736
My brother off his face on junk.

338
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:46,346
Every day there's a question
without an answer.

339
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,520
A leak without a bucket.

340
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
Me without a clue what to do.

341
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,320
Fuck.

342
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,280
I love you, Ada.

343
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,736
Children! Father Christmas has been!

344
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,216
Father Christmas!

345
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,260
What did you ask for?

346
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,057
What have we got?

347
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:17,059
_

348
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,490
Father Christmas got stuck
up the chimney again, did he?

349
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:20,660
Mmm.

350
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,136
What ship are you on tomorrow?

351
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,120
Oh, the best, the most expensive one.

352
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,016
And then we'll get there
and Tommy will say,

353
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,896
"Hello, Lizzie. Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

354
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,736
Come on, Lizzie, he'll be on holiday.

355
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
Being away might change him.

356
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,576
Even on holiday, Ada...

357
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,176
...even on top of a rocky mountain,

358
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,760
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

359
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,880
No more Polly, no more whisky,
no more Tommy.

360
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:17,784
_

361
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,808
_

362
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,456
Yeah, I'm calling from Miquelon Island,

363
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,300
from the police station.

364
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,896
There is a boat leaving the island
now, heading across the border.

365
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,336
When it docks at St John's,

366
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,376
a man named Michael Gray will board
a ferry to Boston.

367
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,220
Listen very carefully.

368
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,376
He's wearing a dark coat, a blue suit,

369
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,856
and carrying a black briefcase.

370
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,200
Inside the briefcase is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

371
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,300
Concerned citizen.

372
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,046
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

373
00:37:03,503 --> 00:37:05,503
_

374
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,400
Yes, I do.

375
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,540
But I don't drink any more.

376
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,080
I have business.

377
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,736
I need to get off this island.

378
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,256
You shouldn't be in here, Karl.

379
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,576
Are you going to answer it?

380
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,840
No, I don't work for him any more.

381
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,256
It might be important.

382
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,120
That's why I don't want to answer it.

383
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,056
Can I answer it?

384
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,360
No.

385
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,020
Hello?

386
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,560
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,160
Fuck.

388
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,360
Do you know who this man is?

389
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,280
All right, come on, Arthur.

390
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,920
Hey, that tickles.

391
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,976
His brother, Thomas Shelby, says
don't serve him opium ever again

392
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,176
or someone will write Arthur
Shelby's name on your chest

393
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
with a bayonet.

394
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,896
So... what the fuck?

395
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,060
I can't talk about anything in here.

396
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,496
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

397
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,016
Tommy Shelby steps back into
your life and, right away,

398
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,256
this is what happens.

399
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,856
No names in here.

400
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,176
Sorry. Let's just call him the devil.

401
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,360
Take a seat.

402
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,696
How is Laurence?

403
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,656
Oh, you know. Missing his father.

404
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,100
What the fuck happened, Michael?

405
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,696
It's in hand.

406
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,140
Whose hand?

407
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,580
No, really. Whose fucking hand,
Michael? Hmm?

408
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,776
Like everything else in this city,

409
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,376
it's in the hand of your Uncle Jack.

410
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,056
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

411
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,776
I already talked to him.

412
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,940
He told me what the devil proposed.

413
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,856
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

414
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,936
He wants to take on Boston?

415
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,096
No-one is taking on anyone.

416
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,820
It's in hand.

417
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,096
There are deals being made at
a high level,

418
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,856
but there are some people at
the middle level

419
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,576
and lower levels who cannot be trusted.

420
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,976
Michael, this sounds fucking...

421
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,360
Shut up and listen.

422
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,660
It was Tommy himself who warned us
of the informant.

423
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,896
We're guessing that the informant

424
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,280
was the one that tipped off the
police about me.

425
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,296
Then the devil's plan has already begun.

426
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,616
What's the point of ships and
planes if you can't get away?

427
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,576
Gina, in today's paper, you will
read about a man being fished out of

428
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,736
the Boston Harbour with
a bleeding heart tattoo

429
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,936
and the name "Maria" written on his arm.

430
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,336
Single shot to the head.

431
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
Yeah, I know, I read it already.

432
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,580
His death will lead to others.

433
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,416
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

434
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,176
And while the clean-up is being
carried out,

435
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,616
you must keep things to yourself.

436
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,376
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

437
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,416
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

438
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,520
Do you understand?

439
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,880
Michael, I just want the truth.

440
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,536
No, fuck that - I need the truth!

441
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,056
Why are you doing business
with him again?

442
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,496
Gina, tell me what you're thinking
of getting Laurence for Christmas.

443
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,736
There are plenty of men who can
supply powder all over the world.

444
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,840
I don't understand why it needs
to be him.

445
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,280
Some of my business with
Tommy Shelby is unfinished.

446
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,960
This is my opportunity to finish it.

447
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,616
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

448
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,960
Hello?

449
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,040
Who?

450
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,040
Sure. Why the hell not?

451
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,080
I heard you were in town
and I thought, well, hey.

452
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,616
Little man hitting the big time.

453
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,816
You like jazz?

454
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,240
No.

455
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,376
What do you want? Whisky?

456
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,816
Water.

457
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,856
I don't have any water.
What else do you want?

458
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,136
I have a message for your Uncle Jack.

459
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,200
Tommy, relax.

460
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,520
Have a fucking drink.

461
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,616
You know my uncle's planning on
buying the United States import

462
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,880
licence to all the best Scotch and
Irish whisky distilleries.

463
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,856
He's on his way to London right
now to make those deals.

464
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,256
Every drop in every state
will be another dime for Uncle Jack.

465
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,160
Yeah. He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

466
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,256
I've only seen photographs -
when he was young, police mug shots,

467
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,776
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

468
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,096
I think this represents progress.

469
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,160
Yeah.

470
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,780
And before you tell me what you want
me to tell him,

471
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,120
I have a message from him to you.

472
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,120
No deal.

473
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,880
Hmm.

474
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,616
In England, when someone gets
this close to Tommy Shelby,

475
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,160
it's, "Oh, the horror.

476
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,080
"Oh, the desire...

477
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,736
"..to fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

478
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,360
"'Yes, sir. Please, sir.'"

479
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,620
So it's Uncle Jack you fall on your
knees for, eh?

480
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,520
Not Michael.

481
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,140
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

482
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,816
You smell of jail, Gina.

483
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,216
And you drink too much.

484
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,936
Yes, but booze is legal.

485
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,959
Your white powder's not.

486
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,616
Jack has friends in the government now.

487
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,040
Do you have any idea how far he's risen?

488
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,600
All the way to the fucking top.

489
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,336
Can't have white powder on his shiny
black boots when he's on his way

490
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,816
to meet the President of
the United States cos,

491
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,760
yeah, that's where he goes now.

492
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,440
So he can't really be taking such
a big risk on such a little deal.

493
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,720
Go home, boy.

494
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,800
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

495
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,536
Yeah, you have another whisky, Gina.

496
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,856
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

497
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,216
You mind if I smoke?

498
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,040
If it's legal, it's OK.

499
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,720
Before I go, you should know...

500
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,576
...that it was me who tipped off
the border police

501
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,060
about the contents of
Michael's suitcase.

502
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,800
I'm the reason he's in jail.

503
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,400
I wanted to give your uncle a dilemma.

504
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:24,520
His favourite niece's husband banged
up in Boston for smuggling opium.

505
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,360
What does he do?

506
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,376
If he intervenes and has him released,

507
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,056
how will that play in the Oval Office?

508
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,936
If he does nothing, how does
that play in South Boston?

509
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,280
Oh, fuck you.

510
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,780
Fine.

511
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,620
Stay here.

512
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,736
Deal here.

513
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,216
Die here, for all I fucking care.

514
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,656
Die at whose hand, Gina? Eh?

515
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,180
My message to your uncle is this.

516
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,248
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,

517
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:09,560
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

518
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,280
Oh, baby.

519
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,696
Do you want to start a fucking war?

520
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,016
With that amount of opium,

521
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,536
the balance of power between the Irish,

522
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,180
the Jewish and the Italians

523
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,360
would shift heavily in
favour of the East.

524
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,696
I have excellent contacts with
the family that runs East Boston.

525
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,616
The Solomons family.

526
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,280
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

527
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:50,040
Once you people have accepted that
you must treat us as equals...

528
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,600
...then I think our families
will work together very well.

529
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,800
Have a good day, Gina.

530
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,400
Yep?

531
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,000
Yes, I'll accept the call.

532
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,896
Hello, Lizzie.

533
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,000
Tommy...

534
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,320
...it's Ruby. She's not well.

535
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,760
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

536
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,136
What did he say?

537
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,696
He says he thinks it's flu,

538
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,740
but he's going to come
later to check on her.

539
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,880
She's been coughing and...

540
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,320
Tommy, he said it's not a
good idea for us to travel.

541
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,160
We can't board that ship
to Boston today.

542
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,420
That's all right, Lizzie, don't worry.

543
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,936
Don't worry, you just stay there for
now and get her better and, er...

544
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,376
Can I speak to her?

545
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,296
She's sleeping.

546
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,696
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

547
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,960
Let her sleep.

548
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,216
Lizzie, I've got a bit more
business to do here.

549
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,256
Look, you just book a new passage
when Ruby's feeling better.

550
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,296
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

551
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,736
just as long as you get here, right?

552
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,020
And then I'll get this business done,

553
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,000
you get here with the children,
and then no more.

554
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,820
And it'll just be us and the
clean air out in the west.

555
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,136
I've found a place in the mountains.

556
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,056
There'll be snow.

557
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,696
Tell Ruby, tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

558
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,976
Hmm.

559
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,936
How long has she been coughing?

560
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,776
A few days.

561
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,816
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

562
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,440
out in the cold by the river.

563
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,520
Are you OK, Tommy?

564
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,056
Your voice, it sounds different.

565
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,780
It's just cold.

566
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,580
I'll get this business done in Boston...

567
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,800
...and that'll be the end of it.

568
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,080
And then I just want to...

569
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,240
...I just want to pick Ruby up
and hold her in my arms, y'know?

570
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,696
I miss the weight of carrying her.

571
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,576
I gave her her presents early.

572
00:51:38,953 --> 00:51:40,393
She loves them.

573
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,976
But last night, she was burning up.

574
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,736
She was delirious.

575
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,456
She kept talking.

576
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,160
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

577
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,760
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

578
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,496
When she was delirious,

579
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,240
she kept saying these Gypsy words, er...

580
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,720
..."Tickner maura, tickner maura, o
beng, o beng," over and over again.

581
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,120
What? Lizzie, what...?

582
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,776
What did you say? What did Ruby say?

583
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,616
"Tickner, tickner maura."

584
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,656
- Something like that.
- Did she say any...

585
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,480
...did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

586
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,376
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

587
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,656
No, Lizzie did she say any
other words in Romany?

588
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,736
Fucking listen to me!

589
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,896
I don't know Romany words, Tommy.

590
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,936
I don't think so.

591
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,176
Just "tickner maura" and "o beng"?

592
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,216
Yes.

593
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,801
Could she see anything when she was
burning up? What could she see?

594
00:52:39,825 --> 00:52:40,793
Oh, fuck.

595
00:52:40,817 --> 00:52:42,936
Lizzie, please,
just answer the fucking question!

596
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,696
She said she could see a man.

597
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,260
A man with green eyes.

598
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,616
She was delirious. She was burning up.

599
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,976
What the fuck is the matter?

600
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,816
Right, listen, Lizzie, I'm coming home.

601
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,576
Tommy, it's just a fever, love.

602
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,736
Listen to me, I'm coming home.
I'll be on the next steamer back.

603
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,136
You keep her out of school. You hear me?

604
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,096
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

605
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,736
- Tommy...
- ..keep her away from the river.

606
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,856
Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.

607
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,616
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives the
words that Ruby has been saying.

608
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,775
Do you hear me?
Tell Johnny's eldest wife

609
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,976
to put a Black Madonna around her neck.

610
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,976
You listen to Esmeralda the same way
you listen to a fucking doctor.

611
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,016
You hear me?

612
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,376
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

613
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,336
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

614
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,656
And you get Curly there.

615
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,216
Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses,

616
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,576
and you do everything that Johnny
Dogs and his wives fucking tell you,

617
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,720
do you understand me?

618
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,136
I'm sorry, Lizzie. Do you understand?

619
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,536
OK. I'll do it.

620
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,560
All right, I'm coming home.

621
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,760
Polly?

622
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,000
Polly?

623
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,320
They know I'm trying to get out.

624
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,800
Pol...

625
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,640
...they're coming for me.

626
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,936
You son of a fucking bitch.

627
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,700
You sound American, Michael.

628
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,896
I have to go back to England early.

629
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,736
Let's make this quick, eh?

630
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,816
You just fuck people up and you
run away.

631
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,336
No, this business will continue.

632
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,696
Jack Nelson is also
travelling to England.

633
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,576
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licenses.

634
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,136
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

635
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,416
Well, I have copies of his itinerary.

636
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,936
Of his personal correspondence.

637
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,936
Letters from the President of
the United States

638
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,736
and his many mistresses.

639
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,096
I have contacts in his organisation.

640
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,380
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

641
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,140
You're dead, Tommy.

642
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,520
You're out of your fucking depth.

643
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,960
You're dead already.

644
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,176
You threatened to sell to the Jews.

645
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,096
And I have contacts in this prison.

646
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,416
These boys here will look after you
during your stay.

647
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,616
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

648
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,176
Jack Nelson's getting me out of here.

649
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,620
Oh, yeah? Is he?

650
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,056
This is a letter.

651
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,780
Here, give him this letter, will ya?

652
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,816
This is a letter from the
President's personal secretary,

653
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,896
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

654
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,480
Just until the press lose interest,
Michael.

655
00:55:58,628 --> 00:55:59,896
Fuck you.

656
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,860
You'll be released eventually.

657
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,300
And then you can execute your
business with me as before.

658
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,296
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

659
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,016
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

660
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,580
and go our separate ways once more, eh?

661
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,720
So, you didn't learn.

662
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,096
When my mother died at
the hands of your ambition,

663
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,960
you didn't learn your limitations.

664
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,120
I have no limitations.

665
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,700
Oh, and by the way, Michael,

666
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,176
according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

667
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,136
he bought passage for five people
from Boston to Liverpool.

668
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:50,336
Five people, his wife, his mistress,

669
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,580
President Roosevelt's son, himself...

670
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,360
...and Gina Gray.

671
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:00,799
Gina's coming to London, Michael...

672
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,296
...where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

673
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,416
Fuck! You fucking bastard, Tommy!

674
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,116
Spirits, Boston Irish and Uncle Jack.

675
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,816
You're the devil, Tommy Shelby!

676
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,580
- You're the fucking devil!
- I'm ready for the conversation.
