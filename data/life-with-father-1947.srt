1
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:21,446
Well, these are certainly
the cleanest steps

2
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,946
on Madison Avenue.

3
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,571
That's how Mr. Day wants them kept.

4
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,738
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:47,404
- You're new here, aren't you?
- Just this mornin'.

6
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:50,070
This is the way Mr. Day
gets his milk.

7
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:53,321
Giddap.

8
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:15,487
Annie, be careful of this dish.
You could burn your hands.

9
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,112
And keep the cover on
till you're ready to serve them.

10
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,362
- Mr. Day likes his muffins hot.
- I'll do that.

11
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:08,279
Annie, is the table set
for breakfast?

12
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:10,112
'Yes, ma'am.'

13
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,821
Good mornin', ma'am.

14
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,821
Good morning, Annie.
How are you getting along?

15
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,487
Alright, ma'am, I hope.

16
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:22,029
Now don't be nervous just
because this is your first day.

17
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:24,154
Everything's
going to be alright.

18
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:27,487
But I do hope
nothing goes wrong.

19
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:30,779
Oh, no, Annie. The cream
and sugar go down at this end.

20
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,154
Oh, I thought
in the center, ma'am

21
00:04:33,237 --> 00:04:34,821
everyone could reach them easy.

22
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:38,321
- Mr. Day sits here.
- Oh, excuse me.

23
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:41,070
I didn't know where to place
the napkins, ma'am.

24
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,987
You can tell by the rings.
The boys have their initials.

25
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,362
C for Clarence. He sits here.

26
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:49,696
J for John, here.

27
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:53,779
W for Whitney. He sits
over there next to his father.

28
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:55,529
And the one
with a little dog on it

29
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,070
is Harlan's, of course.

30
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,029
He's the baby.

31
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,613
This narrow plain one is mine

32
00:05:01,696 --> 00:05:03,738
and this is Mr. Day's.

33
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:08,029
It's just like mine except that
it got bent...one morning.

34
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:09,863
That reminds me, Annie.

35
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,987
Always have Mr. Day's coffee
piping hot.

36
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,279
And whenever Mr. Day speaks
to you, just say yes sir.

37
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,070
Don't be nervous.
You'll get used to him.

38
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:18,029
Yes, ma'am.

39
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,529
Oh, that beautiful rubber plant.

40
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,571
I'm so glad it came.

41
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,446
You mustn't water it every day.

42
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:27,946
Too much moisture
makes it very unhappy.

43
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,029
Oh, good morning, mother.

44
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,404
I thought
you were still upstairs.

45
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:31,696
'Good morning, Clarence.'

46
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:34,154
Father must be talking
to himself.

47
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,779
A redhead.

48
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:41,029
- Did you sleep well, mother?
- Yes, thank you, dear.

49
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:44,112
Golly, I'm hungry.

50
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,571
Oh, and, Annie, we always start
with fruit in the morning.

51
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:48,905
Except the two younger boys who
have their porridge and milk.

52
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,905
'Jiminy, another wreck
on the New Haven.'

53
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:53,237
That always disturbs
the stock market.

54
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,571
Father won't like that.

55
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,070
I do wish the New Haven
would stop having wrecks.

56
00:05:57,154 --> 00:05:59,905
If they knew
how it upsets your father.

57
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:02,404
My soul and body! Clarence,
what's happened to your coat?

58
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,654
Oh, it ripped open again.

59
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,738
Margaret mended it for me

60
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:05,821
but it wouldn't stay mended.

61
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:07,863
Oh, dear,
I'll just have to speak

62
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:11,404
to your father
about a new suit of clothes.

63
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:12,613
Clarence, why did you take

64
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:14,738
my H2SO4
out of our clothes closet?

65
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,321
'I've told you a hundred times'

66
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,696
'that closet's
not to make experiments in.'

67
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,779
Two?

68
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,362
Good morning, mother.

69
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:24,738
John, have you been making
those chemical smells again?

70
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:26,779
No, mother,
I'm making an electric battery.

71
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,321
It will ring a bell
and everything.

72
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:30,446
You know your father
doesn't like electricity.

73
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,779
But, mother, everything's
going to be electricity.

74
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:36,070
- Not in this house.
- 'Oh, God!'

75
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,654
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

76
00:06:39,738 --> 00:06:42,112
- 'Where's my necktie?'
- Which necktie?

77
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,613
'The one I gave you yesterday.'

78
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,987
It isn't pressed yet.
I forgot to give it to Margaret.

79
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,196
'I told you distinctly I wanted
to wear that necktie today.'

80
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,863
You've got plenty of neckties.

81
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,237
Put on another one right away
and come down to breakfast.

82
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,821
'I don't know
what this world's coming to.'

83
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,487
Mother,
may I have my breakfast early?

84
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:02,487
I'm going to play baseball.

85
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,446
Three?

86
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:05,738
Whitney,
before you leave the house

87
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,196
you have to study
your catechism.

88
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,529
But, mother, they're going
to let me pitch today.

89
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,154
Good morning.

90
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:12,987
- Who won?
- The Giants, 7 to 3.

91
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,946
- Buck Ewing hit a home run.
- Let me see.

92
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:18,029
Boys, don't wrinkle the paper
before your father sees it.

93
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,654
Mother, could you ask me
my catechism now?

94
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:23,446
- I think I know it.
- Well, let's see.

95
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,487
- Ah, what is your name?
- Whitney Benjamin.

96
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,321
- Who gave you your--
- 'Here I come!'

97
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,279
Come and help me down, mother.

98
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:35,112
There are steps to come down on.

99
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,946
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, mother.

100
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:39,029
- How's your finger?
- It itches.

101
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,196
Good. That's a sign
it's getting better.

102
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,029
Come along.

103
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,070
Four!

104
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:47,613
Let's see. What was I doing?

105
00:07:47,696 --> 00:07:50,237
Oh, yes, the catechism.

106
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:51,779
Who gave you your name?

107
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,196
My sponsors at baptism

108
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,362
wherein I was made a member
of Christ

109
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:56,696
the child of God

110
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,154
and an inheritor
of the kingdom of heaven.

111
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,654
Mother,
if I hadn't been baptized

112
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,112
wouldn't I have any name?

113
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:05,779
Not in the sight of the church.

114
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,029
What did your sponsors
then for you?

115
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,821
They did promise and vow
three things in my name.

116
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:13,696
First, that I should renounce
the devil and all of his..

117
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:20,362
'And secondly..'

118
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:22,237
'...secondly, that I believe'

119
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,613
'all the articles
of the Christian faith.'

120
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:27,779
And thirdly, that I should keep

121
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,779
God's holy will and commandments

122
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:32,154
'and walk in the same
all the days of my--'

123
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:35,279
Morning, boys. Morning.

124
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:37,196
- Good morning, father.
- Good morning, father.

125
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,112
Morning, Vinnie.
Had a good night?

126
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:41,446
- Yes, thank you, Clare.
- Good.

127
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,571
Sit down, boys.

128
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,029
What's that thing doing in here?

129
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:47,404
Clare,
that's our new rubber plant.

130
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,404
Place for rubber plants
is on the equator.

131
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,821
Uh, take that object out,
Catherine.

132
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:55,070
- You're not Catherine.
- No, sir.

133
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:57,529
Good.
Never liked Catherine, anyway.

134
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:02,571
Put it somewhere else, Annie,
but not too near a window.

135
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,613
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:04,987
Sit down, Harlan.

137
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,571
Thank you, dear.

138
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:18,571
Where did that dog come from?

139
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,946
She'll leave, mother.
I'll talk to her.

140
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,613
What did you say?

141
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,196
Oh, Clare,
that new suit looks very nice.

142
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,905
You've put on a little weight,
dear.

143
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:30,154
I weigh just the same
as I always have.

144
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,070
Well, Clarence has just
managed to ruin

145
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,279
the only decent suit he has.

146
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:37,362
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid he'll
need a new suit of clothes.

147
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,613
Vinnie, Clarence has to learn

148
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,112
not to be so hard
on his clothes.

149
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:41,196
But, father, I thought--

150
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,279
You're starting Yale
in the fall.

151
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,779
You'll be completely outfitted.

152
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,112
But nothing this summer.

153
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:47,654
Can I have one of your old suits
cut down for me?

154
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:50,779
Every suit I own
still has plenty of wear in it.

155
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,987
I wear my clothes
until they're worn out.

156
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,654
Well, if you want
your clothes worn out

157
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,571
Clarence can wear them out
much faster than you can.

158
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,154
Yes, and, father, you never get
a chance to wear yours out.

159
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,571
Every time
you get a new batch of clothes

160
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:03,154
mother sends the old ones
to the missionary barrel.

161
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:05,487
I guess I'm just as good
as any old missionary.

162
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,571
Clarence, before you compare
yourself to a missionary

163
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,821
'remember the sacrifices
they make.'

164
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,779
Oh, I don't know, Vinnie.

165
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,946
I think my clothes
would look better on Clarence

166
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,487
than on some Hottentot.

167
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,237
Have that, uh, dark suit of mine
cut down to fit you.

168
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,654
Well, thank you, father.

169
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:24,613
One of father's suits.
Thank you, sir.

170
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,279
In return for that, Clarence

171
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:29,863
I want you to practice
more often on your violin.

172
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,196
Whitney, don't eat so fast.

173
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,446
Well, father,
I'm going to pitch today.

174
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,029
But before I go,
I have to study my catechism.

175
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,196
What do you bother
with that for?

176
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,863
Because if he doesn't know
his catechism

177
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,237
he can't be confirmed.

178
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:44,362
But, Vinnie,
Whitney's going to pitch today.

179
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:46,696
He can be confirmed
any old time.

180
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,487
Clare, sometimes
it seems to me you don't care

181
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,362
whether your children
get to heaven or not.

182
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:53,362
Oh, Whitney will get to heaven
alright.

183
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:54,946
I'll be there before you are,
Whitney.

184
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,362
I'll see that you get in.

185
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,112
And, Whitney,
when we get to heaven

186
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,321
we'll organize a baseball team
of our own.

187
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,613
- Good.
- Hmm.

188
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,279
Be just like you to try
and run things up there.

189
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:05,696
Well, from all I've heard
about heaven

190
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,321
it seems to be a pretty
unbusiness-like place.

191
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:10,571
They could probably use
a good man like me.

192
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,821
What makes you so sure
they'll let you in to heaven?

193
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,487
Well, if they don't,
I'll certainly raise

194
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,571
a devil of a row.

195
00:11:17,654 --> 00:11:22,029
Clare, I do hope you'll behave
when you get to heaven.

196
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:24,070
Now, Vinnie, what..

197
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,571
Vinnie, how many times have I
asked you not to engage a maid

198
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,863
who doesn't know
how to serve properly?

199
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:33,738
Clare, can't you see
she's new and doing her best?

200
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,321
How can I serve myself
when she's holding that platter

201
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,237
over my head?

202
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,905
- Hold it lower, Annie.
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:47,112
What became of the one
we had yesterday?

204
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,529
I don't know
why you can't keep a maid.

205
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:51,362
Oh, you don't!

206
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,987
Why on earth
can't you run your house

207
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,279
the way I run my office?

208
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:57,321
All I want is service.

209
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:01,446
What the devil's that noise?

210
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:06,112
- It's Annie.
- Annie? Who's Annie?

211
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:07,863
The maid.

212
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:10,029
I'll take it, Annie.

213
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,905
Clare,
aren't you ashamed of yourself?

214
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,279
What have I done now?

215
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,404
You made her cry,
speaking to her the way you did.

216
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,529
I never said a word to her.

217
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,654
I was addressing myself to you.

218
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,112
I do wish you'd be more careful.

219
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,362
It's hard enough to keep a maid

220
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,738
and the uniform
just fit this one.

221
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,487
'What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?'

222
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,987
What in the name of..

223
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,070
Well, where did you come from?

224
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,154
- Who do you belong to?
- She's mine, father.

225
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:55,237
Her name is Princess.

226
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,196
Hmm, looks more
like a prince to me.

227
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:06,905
- Margaret, this bacon's good.
- Oh.

228
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:10,404
- Well, it's good.
- Yes, sir.

229
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,779
Harlan, how's that finger?

230
00:13:12,863 --> 00:13:14,905
'Come here, let me see it.'

231
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:16,571
Yes, father.

232
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,279
Ah, yes,
that's healing nicely.

233
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,613
I guess you'll know
the next time

234
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,613
that cats don't like
to be hugged.

235
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,362
It's alright to stroke them,
but don't squeeze them.

236
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:30,987
Now go back
and finish your oatmeal.

237
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,446
I don't like oatmeal.

238
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,863
Go on and finish it.
It's good for you.

239
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,571
But I don't like it.

240
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,863
I'll tell you what you like
and what you don't like.

241
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:40,196
You're not old enough
to know about such things.

242
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,487
You've no business
not to like oatmeal.

243
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,070
- It's good.
- I hate it!

244
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,654
That's enough!
We won't discuss it.

245
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,863
Eat that oatmeal at once!

246
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:58,070
Ugh.

247
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,905
John, that letter's
for your mother.

248
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:11,112
I finished my oatmeal, father.
May I be excused?

249
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,613
Yes, Whitney, you may go.
Pitch a good game.

250
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,362
I will.

251
00:14:15,446 --> 00:14:16,987
Whitney.

252
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,196
Yes, mother, my catechism.

253
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,196
Never mind this morning,
darling. Run along.

254
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,404
Thank you, mother.

255
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,487
Margaret, what is this?

256
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,154
- Coffee, sir.
- It is not coffee.

257
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,279
You couldn't possibly take
water and coffee beans

258
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:35,738
and arrive at that.
It's slops. That's what it is.

259
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:37,571
Slops! Take it away.

260
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:39,446
I come down to this table
every morning hungry--

261
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:40,905
'Well, if you're hungry, Clare'

262
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,654
'why aren't you eating
your breakfast?'

263
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:45,738
I am.

264
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:48,362
Aunt Judith wants me
to come up and visit her.

265
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:53,279
Now, Vinnie, I want no more
relatives in this house.

266
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,946
We're going to live here
by ourselves

267
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,487
in peace and comfort.

268
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:00,029
Clare, I was saying Aunt Judith
wants me to visit her.

269
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:03,237
- Oh.
- Eat your oatmeal, dear.

270
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,654
What on earth is this?

271
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,070
"Dear friend Day,
we are assigning you

272
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,946
"the exclusive rights
to Staten Island

273
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:11,321
for selling
the Gem Home Popover Popcorn."

274
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:14,070
I think that's for me, father.

275
00:15:14,154 --> 00:15:17,654
But then why isn't it
addressed to Clarence Day, Jr.?

276
00:15:17,738 --> 00:15:19,154
Oh, it is.

277
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,654
I wouldn't get mixed up
in popcorn, Clarence.

278
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:24,196
It's too indigestible.

279
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,529
Confound it!
Another wreck on the New Haven.

280
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:27,987
If you please, ma'am,
there's a dollar due

281
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,321
on a package.
It's from Lewis & Congers.

282
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,487
'Oh, yes, those kitchen knives
I ordered.'

283
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,112
Ah, make a memorandum of that,
Vinnie.

284
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:35,946
One dollar
and whatever it was for.

285
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,154
Of course, Clare.

286
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,571
I must have a record
of what is spent

287
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:40,779
running this house.

288
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,821
I've never understood
what good a record is

289
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:44,154
after the money's gone.

290
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:45,529
There's just a dollar, Margaret.

291
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,821
Vinnie, this house must be run
on a business basis.

292
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,571
That's what
the household accounts are for.

293
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,654
Oh, Clare, it's half past 8:00.

294
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:54,487
'You don't wanna be late
at the office.'

295
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,070
Plenty of time.

296
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,654
- Annie, clear the table now.
- Yes, ma'am, I'll do that.

297
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,529
- Clarence, John.
- Yes, mother?

298
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,613
You boys go up
and move the small bureau

299
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,863
from my room into yours.

300
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,196
- Who's coming?
- Cousin Cora.

301
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,696
And she's bringing a friend
with her.

302
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,946
- A young girl.
- A girl!

303
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:11,613
You'll have to help
entertain her, Clarence.

304
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:12,863
Oh, mother, do I have to?

305
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:14,696
Wait till father finds out
we've got

306
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,154
visitors. There'll be a rumpus.

307
00:16:16,237 --> 00:16:18,070
John, don't criticize
your father.

308
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:21,905
He's very hospitable
after he gets used to the idea.

309
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:23,863
- I like coffee. I like tea.
- Tsk, tsk.

310
00:16:23,946 --> 00:16:25,696
I like the girls
and the girls like me.

311
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,613
Well, I don't like girls
and they don't like me.

312
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,446
- 'Oh, God!'
- Go on, boys. Go on.

313
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,154
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

314
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,529
How did that get in this room?

315
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,905
Now, Clare,
how was the new maid to know?

316
00:16:40,987 --> 00:16:42,321
Keep that abomination
out of here.

317
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,237
Alright, I'll take it.

318
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:49,571
Oh, Clare dear, I'm afraid

319
00:16:49,654 --> 00:16:51,696
I'm going to need
some more money.

320
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,863
You were complaining
about the coffee this morning.

321
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,321
Well, that nice French drip
coffee pot is broken

322
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:57,779
and you know how it got broken.

323
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,112
Never mind that, Vinnie.

324
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:05,571
As I remember that coffee pot
cost $5 and, uh, something.

325
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:07,487
I'll give you $6.

326
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:09,237
Uh, when you get it, Vinnie

327
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,070
enter the exact amount
in the ledger.

328
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,112
Of course, Clare.

329
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,738
We can't go on month after month

330
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,905
having the household accounts
in such a mess.

331
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:18,070
No, and I thought of a system

332
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,905
that will make my bookkeeping
perfect.

333
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:21,821
Well, I'm certainly relieved
to hear that.

334
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:25,446
All we have to do is open
charge accounts everywhere

335
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,321
and the stores will do
my bookkeeping for me.

336
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:29,571
Now wait a minute, Vinnie--

337
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,029
Then when the bills come in

338
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,279
you'd know exactly
where your money had gone.

339
00:17:33,362 --> 00:17:34,779
Yes, I certainly would.

340
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:37,362
Vinnie,
we get enough bills as it is.

341
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:40,112
Clare dear, don't you hate
those arguments

342
00:17:40,196 --> 00:17:41,738
we have every month?

343
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,404
I certainly do.

344
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,196
Not to have those,
I should think would be worth

345
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,154
something to you.

346
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:52,487
Well, I'll open an account
at Lewis & Congers

347
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,738
and, uh, one at McCreery's
to start with.

348
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,946
- Thank you, Clare.
- We'll see how it works out.

349
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,070
Thank you.

350
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:02,279
Oh, the rector's
coming to tea today.

351
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:04,446
The rector.
Well, I'm glad you warned me.

352
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:05,863
I'll go to the club.

353
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:08,154
Don't expect me home
until dinnertime.

354
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,571
Clare dear,
I do wish you'd take

355
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,821
a little more interest
in the church.

356
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:15,404
Getting me into heaven
is your business, Vinnie.

357
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:18,029
If there's anything wrong
with my ticket when I get there

358
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,821
you can fix it up.

359
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:23,029
Everybody loves you so much.
I'm sure God must too.

360
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:25,321
I'll do my best, Clare.

361
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,154
It wouldn't be heaven
without you.

362
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,237
If you're there, Vinnie,
I'll manage to get in some way

363
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,946
even if I have to climb
the fence.

364
00:18:44,237 --> 00:18:45,946
Margaret. Margaret.

365
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,571
'Oh, God!'

366
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,362
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

367
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:54,404
Why did God make so many
dumb fools and Democrats?

368
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:56,029
Ah, politics.

369
00:18:56,112 --> 00:18:59,154
Yes, but it's taking the bread
out of our mouths!

370
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:02,863
Honest Hugh Grant.

371
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:05,696
Honest, bah!

372
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,362
Fine mayor
you've turned out to be.

373
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,529
If you can't run this city
without raising taxes

374
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:12,613
every five minutes,
you'd better get out.

375
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:14,779
Let someone who can.

376
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,112
Richard Cook
is running in this town

377
00:19:17,196 --> 00:19:19,863
and you're just his cat's paw!

378
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:22,613
Tell me this,
are these increased taxes

379
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,362
going into public improvements

380
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,362
or are they going into graft?

381
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:28,279
Answer me that honestly
if you can

382
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,070
Mr. Honest Hugh Grant.

383
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:31,863
You can't? I thought so.

384
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:33,362
Bah!

385
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,154
- Don't order dinner..
- 'You were elected to office..'

386
00:19:35,237 --> 00:19:36,571
'...on the promise
that you would put an end'

387
00:19:36,654 --> 00:19:38,487
'to all this thievery
and corruption.'

388
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:41,905
'Have you put an end to it?
No. You've encouraged it.'

389
00:19:41,987 --> 00:19:45,404
'Every day there's some new raid
on the public treasury.'

390
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:48,321
- If you don't stop..
- Father, if you don't mind..

391
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,070
...of New York,
we're going to throw you

392
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,946
and your boodle board
of aldermen out of office.

393
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:55,196
I'm warning you
for the last time.

394
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,112
Robbery. That's what it is.
Highway robbery!

395
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:00,321
- Annie. Annie.
- What is it?

396
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,571
Take this fresh cup of coffee
in to Mr. Day.

397
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,529
But Mr. Day's got a visitor.

398
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:06,571
'...are not going to tolerate
these..'

399
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,571
Nonsense. Run along in there.

400
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,779
We pay you a good round sum
to watch after our interests

401
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:14,279
and all we get is inefficiency.

402
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,070
I know you're a nincompoop

403
00:20:16,154 --> 00:20:19,987
and I strongly suspect you
of being a scalawag.

404
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,196
You're not going to escape
your legal responsibilities.

405
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,654
Legal responsibilities?

406
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:28,237
By God, I mean
criminal responsibilities!

407
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:31,029
Don't think for one minute
we're going to let you escape.

408
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:34,070
We're going to throw you
into jail!

409
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,946
- Annie, are you hurt?
- He can't throw me into jail!

410
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,446
Vinnie?

411
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,613
Vinnie, why can't I have
quiet here in the morning?

412
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,279
Clare, what happened?

413
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:53,738
Uh, sounded to me
as though that maid

414
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:54,905
dropped a whole tray of dishes.

415
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,738
Yes,
but what did you say to her?

416
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:00,070
Say to her? I haven't seen her
since breakfast.

417
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,905
- I better get to the office.
- Oh, yes, Clare.

418
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,321
You don't want to be late.

419
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:05,696
I'll be home in plenty of time
for dinner.

420
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,905
Why don't we have
chicken fricassee tonight?

421
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:10,863
Well, Clare, chicken's gone up.
It's 8 cents a pound.

422
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,279
Where the devil's she going
dressed up like that?

423
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:30,487
Clare, you've done it again.
How could you?

424
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:33,654
- How could I what?
- Can't you see she's leaving?

425
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:36,070
Oh, dear. I have no time
to engage a new maid.

426
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:39,779
- We'll have to have dinner out.
- Dinner out. Nonsense.

427
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,446
- I'll engage a new maid myself.
- Clare, you can't.

428
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,529
- She has to fit the uniform.
- I'll have one here in an hour.

429
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:47,613
- 'Goodbye, dear.'
- 'Goodbye, Clare.'

430
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,863
Good morning, Mr. Day.
On your way to the office?

431
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,613
- Yes.. Good morning.
- Mrs. Day.

432
00:21:56,613 --> 00:21:58,987
- Good morning, Mr. Day.
- Morning, Jim.

433
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,112
Giddap!

434
00:22:06,196 --> 00:22:07,362
Giddap.

435
00:22:23,446 --> 00:22:25,654
Cora, it's wonderful to see you.

436
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,070
Oh, thank you.

437
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,863
Oh, Vinnie,
I declare you're getting

438
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,571
younger and prettier every year.

439
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:34,779
- Oh, this is Mary Skinner.
- Ed Skinner's daughter.

440
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:37,487
My goodness,
I never would have known you.

441
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,446
Just leave your things out here
and come right on in.

442
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,154
I heard my father talk so much
about you, Mrs. Day.

443
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,863
Oh, did he tell you
how he used to dip my pigtails

444
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,362
in the inkwell at school?

445
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,696
What's the news
in Pleasantville, Cora?

446
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:53,738
Oh, Vinnie,
I have so much to tell you.

447
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:55,905
We wrote you
that Aunt Carrie broke her hip.

448
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:58,112
That was the night
that Robert Ingersoll lectured.

449
00:22:58,196 --> 00:23:00,154
Of course, she couldn't get
there, but it was a good thing

450
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,529
for Mr. Ingersoll she didn't.

451
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,279
'How do you do, Cousin Cora?'

452
00:23:03,362 --> 00:23:06,029
Oh, Clarence, my, my.

453
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:08,112
No, no, Cora, this is John.

454
00:23:08,196 --> 00:23:10,571
John! Why, how you've grown.

455
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:13,237
You'll be a man
before your mother.

456
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:15,154
'John, this is Mary Skinner.'

457
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,196
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

458
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,821
Vinnie, everybody in
Pleasantville sends their love.

459
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,987
Grandpa Evans, Cousin Edith,
Aunt Hattie, the Taylors.

460
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,946
- Oh, just everybody.
- Cora, how is Grandpa Evans?

461
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,487
Oh, he hasn't been at all well.

462
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,738
You know, he only has one kidney
and that's bloating.

463
00:23:29,821 --> 00:23:31,946
How do you do, Cousin Cora?
I'm glad to see you.

464
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:34,196
This can't be Clarence.

465
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,112
- Yes, it is.
- My, my.

466
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,487
My goodness,
every time I see you boys

467
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,696
you've grown another foot.

468
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,571
Let's see, you're going
to St. Paul's now, aren't you?

469
00:23:44,654 --> 00:23:47,487
St. Paul's? I was through
with St. Paul's long ago.

470
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,654
I'm starting in Yale this fall.

471
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:50,987
Yale!

472
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,196
Oh, uh, oh, Mary,
this is Clarence.

473
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,905
- Mary Skinner.
- How do you do?

474
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:58,821
Oh, this is Mary's
first trip to New York.

475
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:01,154
Yes, it is.
It's her first trip.

476
00:24:01,237 --> 00:24:03,779
We'll have to show Mary around.

477
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:05,946
Oh, I'll tell you,
I'll ask Mr. Day

478
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,321
to take us all to Delmonico's
for dinner tonight.

479
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,863
- Delmonico's!
- Think of that, Mary.

480
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,237
Delmonico's!

481
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,362
And Cousin Clare's
such a wonderful host.

482
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:17,321
Well, I know you girls want
to freshen up, so come upstairs.

483
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:18,821
Clarence, get their bags.

484
00:24:18,905 --> 00:24:20,529
I've given you girls
Clarence's room

485
00:24:20,613 --> 00:24:22,446
but he didn't know about it
until this morning.

486
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,196
- I don't want you to give..
- He hasn't moved his things..

487
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,070
John, get their old bags.

488
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:34,404
Oh, you play the violin.

489
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:37,529
Well, I, I fool with it
a little.

490
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,571
You're just being modest.

491
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:42,362
No, really, I..

492
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,070
I play the piano.

493
00:24:44,154 --> 00:24:46,863
Not awfully well, but..

494
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:49,196
Now you're being modest.

495
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:53,196
Do you ever play duets?

496
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,154
Well, I haven't up to now.

497
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:01,404
Neither have I...up to now.

498
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,905
Cora didn't tell me about you.

499
00:25:08,987 --> 00:25:12,112
I never met a Yale man before.

500
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,905
What's happened to you?

501
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,987
Nothing. I feel fine.

502
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,946
Where do you keep 'em?

503
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,362
Do you wish a domestic servant?

504
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:50,446
Where do you keep them?

505
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:51,946
I will take your name
and address.

506
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:54,112
Confound it.
I'm late at the office now.

507
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:55,738
If you will give me the details

508
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,613
as to what kind of person
you require.

509
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,613
I'm asking you
where you keep them?

510
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:02,154
Why, the girls are in there

511
00:26:02,237 --> 00:26:04,446
but clients are not allowed
in that room.

512
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,404
If you will tell me
the kind of a position you wish

513
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:09,362
to have held,
I'll be very glad to..

514
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,654
You stand up, please.

515
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,070
Sir, this is quite
against the rules.

516
00:26:24,154 --> 00:26:26,321
I must know
what you want the girl for.

517
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:27,821
I'll take that one.
What's your name?

518
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:29,154
Hilda, sir.

519
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:31,654
Hilda, you go right over
to 420 Madison Avenue.

520
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:33,905
- I will, sir.
- That's all. Thank you.

521
00:26:33,987 --> 00:26:36,987
Sir, before I can let any girl
go from this establishment

522
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,112
I must know the character
of the home

523
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:40,779
in which she will be employed.

524
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:43,446
Madam,
I am the character of my home.

525
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,154
Oh.

526
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:50,571
My duty toward my neighbor
is to love him as myself

527
00:26:50,654 --> 00:26:54,821
and to do unto all men as, as..

528
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,571
As they should do unto me.

529
00:26:56,654 --> 00:27:01,321
As they should do unto me
to, to..

530
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:02,654
He really knows it.

531
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:05,987
Well, he's done very well
for so young a boy.

532
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,321
- May I go now?
- Yes, darling.

533
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:09,863
- Thank you, Dr. Lloyd.
- Not at all.

534
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,696
Come on, Harlan.

535
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,987
Wait for me.

536
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,987
Ah, you and Mr. Day must be
very proud of your children.

537
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,237
I was hoping I'd find Mr. Day
at home this afternoon.

538
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,154
Well, he-he's usually home
from the office by this time.

539
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:27,863
Hmm. Perhaps he's gone
for a gallop in the park.

540
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,654
It's such a fine day.

541
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,779
He's very fond
of horseback riding, I believe.

542
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:32,779
Oh, yes.

543
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,446
Tell me, has he ever been

544
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,863
thrown from a horse?

545
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,279
Oh, no,
no horse would throw Mr. Day.

546
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:41,696
I just thought he might
have had some accident.

547
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:44,529
I notice
he never kneels in church.

548
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:46,529
Oh, that's no accident.

549
00:27:46,613 --> 00:27:49,279
Uh, but I don't want you
to think he doesn't pray.

550
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,404
He does.

551
00:27:50,487 --> 00:27:51,654
Why, sometimes you can hear him

552
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,362
all over the house.

553
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,446
But he never kneels.

554
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,529
Ah, perhaps that's Mr. Day now.

555
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,404
Oh, I hardly think so.

556
00:28:05,237 --> 00:28:07,279
Oh, the devil. I forgot.

557
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:09,112
Clare,
you're just in time for tea.

558
00:28:09,196 --> 00:28:12,196
- I'll send for some hot water.
- How are you, Dr. Lloyd?

559
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,863
'It's a great pleasure to have
a visit with you, Mr. Day.'

560
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:17,905
- Mother, are they back yet?
- No, Clarence, no.

561
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,070
'Except for a brief glimpse
on the Sabbath'

562
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:21,654
I don't see much of you.

563
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:24,196
Well, Clare, did you have
a busy day at the office?

564
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,196
- Devilishly busy.
- Clare.

565
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,279
Uh, a very busy day. Tired out.

566
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:32,279
How a man can get tired

567
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,237
just sitting at a desk all day,
I don't know.

568
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:38,154
I suppose Wall Street
is just as much a mystery to you

569
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:39,487
as it is to me, Dr. Lloyd.

570
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:41,905
No, no.
It's all very clear to me.

571
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,738
My mind often goes
to the businessman.

572
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,905
The picture I'm most fond on
is when I envision him

573
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,946
at the close of the day's work.

574
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,613
I see him pausing in his toil
and it comes over him

575
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:56,070
that all those figures
of profit and loss

576
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:59,987
are without importance
or consequence.

577
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,404
Vanity and dust.

578
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:04,738
- Well, I'll be--
- Clare.

579
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,613
- Yes, ma'am?
- 'Delia, some more hot water.'

580
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:12,571
- Yes, ma'am.
- Who's that?

581
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:13,905
The new maid.

582
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:15,821
Where's the one I sent
this morning?

583
00:29:15,905 --> 00:29:18,029
The uniform didn't fit.

584
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:20,905
Hmm. I like the one
I picked out better.

585
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:24,654
Uh, Clare,
Dr. Lloyd wants to tell us

586
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,905
about the plans
for the new edifice.

587
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:29,487
- The new what?
- The new church.

588
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:31,987
You knew we were planning
to build a new church.

589
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,654
Of course, we're going to have
to raise a large sum of money.

590
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:37,571
Hmm. Well, personally,
I am against the church

591
00:29:37,654 --> 00:29:39,696
hop, skipping and jumping
all over the town.

592
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,070
So any contribution I make
will have to be a small one.

593
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:44,987
The amount
everyone is to subscribe

594
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,779
has already been decided.

595
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:47,905
Who decided it?

596
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,738
After considerable thought

597
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,654
we voted
that our supporting members

598
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:56,196
should each contribute a sum
equal to the cost of their pew.

599
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,196
I paid $5000 for my pew.

600
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:02,571
Yes, Clare. That makes
our contribution $5000.

601
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:04,362
That's robbery.

602
00:30:04,446 --> 00:30:07,654
Do you know what that pew
is worth today? $3000.

603
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,571
That's what
the last one sold for.

604
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:12,696
I've taken a dead loss of $2000
on that pew already.

605
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,529
Frank Bags sold me that pew
when the market was at its peak.

606
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:19,196
He knew when to get out.

607
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,029
And I'm warning you, Vinnie,
if the market ever goes up

608
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,863
I'm going to unload that pew.

609
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:28,362
Clarence Day, how can you speak
of the temple of the Lord

610
00:30:28,446 --> 00:30:31,362
as though it was something to be
bought and sold on Wall Street?

611
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:34,696
Now, Mrs. Day, your husband
is a practical man.

612
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,863
We've had to be practical
about the new church.

613
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:40,237
We have all the facts
and figures.

614
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:43,946
Oh. What's the property worth
where we are now?

615
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,321
Oh, let's see. Is it $40,000?

616
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:50,404
I know the figure
has a four in it.

617
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:53,154
What's the new piece of property
going to cost you?

618
00:30:53,237 --> 00:30:57,404
I think the figure I heard
mentioned was $85,000.

619
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:01,237
Or was it 185,000?

620
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:03,404
Uh, Dr. Lloyd,
you preach that someday

621
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,446
we'll all have to answer to God.

622
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,571
We shall indeed.

623
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:09,571
Well, I hope God doesn't
ask you any questions

624
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:11,571
with figures in them.

625
00:31:14,154 --> 00:31:15,738
'Mrs. Day
is in the living room.'

626
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:17,112
'Thank you.'

627
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:19,112
- I-it's Cousin Cora.
- Hmm?

628
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:22,279
- She's passing through town.
- Oh.

629
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:25,321
Well.

630
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,321
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

631
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,821
- Hello.
- Thank you for helping me.

632
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:33,863
Come, Mary.

633
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:35,696
Oh, Vinnie, what a day.

634
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:38,404
We've been in every shop
in town.

635
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,696
- Why, Cousin Clare.
- 'Cora.'

636
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,112
My, my.

637
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,112
You're as welcome
as the flowers in May.

638
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:46,696
- This is Mary Skinner. Mr. Day.
- How do you do?

639
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,446
I've been telling Mary
all about you.

640
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:51,821
- She's been dying to meet you.
- Well.

641
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:53,154
Dr. Lloyd, I want you to meet

642
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:54,946
my favorite cousin,
Miss Cartwright.

643
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:56,779
- How do you do?
- And this is Mary Skinner.

644
00:31:56,863 --> 00:31:58,154
Miss Skinner, Dr. Lloyd.

645
00:31:58,237 --> 00:31:59,863
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

646
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,905
Well, this seems to be
a family reunion.

647
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:05,237
- I'll just run along.
- Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.

648
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:06,821
Uh, goodbye, Miss Cartwright.

649
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:08,070
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, uh..

650
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,321
Oh, Clarence, you haven't said

651
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:10,654
how do you do to Dr. Lloyd.

652
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,154
Goodbye, Dr. Lloyd.

653
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:14,029
- Oh.
- Uh, goodbye, everybody.

654
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,529
I'll go to the door with you,
Dr. Lloyd.

655
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:17,863
Thank you.
Thank you so much for the tea.

656
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:19,321
Those muffins were delicious.

657
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,154
Who did you say
this pretty little girl is?

658
00:32:21,237 --> 00:32:22,654
She's Ed Skinner's daughter.

659
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,696
This is Mary's first trip
to New York.

660
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,487
Oh, uh, sit down. Sit down.

661
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,821
- Have some tea.
- We had tea downtown.

662
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,446
- Oh, uh, never mind then, uh..
- Delia.

663
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,654
Delia.
Uh, sit down, sit down.

664
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:36,654
Even if you have had tea, you
can stay and visit for a while.

665
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:39,779
As a matter of fact, why don't
you both stay to dinner?

666
00:32:39,863 --> 00:32:41,154
That's all arranged, Clare.

667
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,863
Cora and Mary are going
to have dinner with us.

668
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:45,196
Fine, fine.

669
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,196
Of course, you'll just
have to take potluck.

670
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,362
- Well, I'd hardly call it--
- Clare.

671
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,446
Did you know the girls
are going to visit Aunt Judith

672
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:54,029
in Springfield
for a whole month?

673
00:32:54,112 --> 00:32:55,362
Fine.

674
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,404
Now how long are you going
to be in New York, Cora?

675
00:32:57,487 --> 00:32:59,613
- All week.
- Splendid.

676
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:00,863
We'll hope to see
something of you.

677
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,404
Well, you certainly will--

678
00:33:02,487 --> 00:33:05,029
Cora, d-did you find anything
you wanted in the shop?

679
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:06,696
Oh, I can't wait to show you.

680
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,738
Oh, but I'm afraid
some of these packages

681
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,696
can't be opened
in front of Cousin Clare.

682
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:13,571
Shall I leave the room?

683
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:22,029
Oh, Clarence, would you take
the package in the hall

684
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:24,779
up to our room,
or should I say your room?

685
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:27,029
Wasn't it nice of Clarence
to give up his room

686
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,654
to us for a whole week?

687
00:33:28,738 --> 00:33:31,446
Cora, come on, I just can't wait
to see what's in those packages.

688
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:35,237
Well, we'll be back soon.

689
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:38,738
Uh, uh, Vinnie, I wish to speak
to you before you go upstairs.

690
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:40,237
I'll be down in just a minute,
Clare.

691
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,529
I wish to speak to you now.

692
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,404
I'll be up in just a minute,
Cora.

693
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,321
It's alright, Vinnie.
Come along, Mary.

694
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,779
Are those two women
encamped in our house?

695
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,070
- Now, Clare--
- Answer me, Vinnie.

696
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:51,404
- Now, Clare, you know--
- Answer me!

697
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,613
Just a minute. Clarence!

698
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,112
Now, Clare, you know
you've always been fond of Cora.

699
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:04,070
What has that got to do with her
packing herself down in my house

700
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,738
and bringing hordes of strangers
with her?

701
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:07,613
How can you call
that sweet little girl

702
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:08,946
a horde of strangers?

703
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,613
Why don't they go to a hotel?

704
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:13,321
New York is full of hotels
built for the express purpose

705
00:34:13,404 --> 00:34:14,863
of housing such nuisances.

706
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:17,112
Clare,
two girls alone in a hotel.

707
00:34:17,196 --> 00:34:18,821
Why, who knows
what might happen to them?

708
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:20,905
Alright, then put them
on the first train.

709
00:34:20,987 --> 00:34:22,571
They want to roam like gypsies?

710
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:24,029
Lend them a hand.
Keep them roaming!

711
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:25,863
But, Clare, they're just
staying in that little room

712
00:34:25,946 --> 00:34:27,237
of Clarence's.

713
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:28,654
The trouble is,
they don't stay there.

714
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:30,112
They stay in the bathroom.

715
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:31,738
Every time
I want to take my bath

716
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:35,446
it's full of giggling females
washing their hair!

717
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:37,946
I tell you, I won't have it.
Send them to a hotel.

718
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:40,362
I'll pay the bill gladly,
but get them out of here.

719
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,446
Father, I'm afraid
they can hear you upstairs.

720
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:45,029
Then keep those doors closed.

721
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:47,696
Clarence, you open those doors.

722
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:49,571
Open them all the way.

723
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:54,487
Now, Clare, you be quiet
and behave yourself.

724
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,571
They're here,
and they're going to stay here.

725
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:01,654
That's enough, Vinnie.
I want no more of this argument.

726
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:03,237
Hmm.

727
00:35:09,987 --> 00:35:12,279
Oh, chaa!

728
00:35:13,905 --> 00:35:17,196
What I don't understand is
why this swarm of locusts

729
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,529
always descends on us
without any warning.

730
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:21,029
Oh, thunder!

731
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:31,321
'Vinnie, dear Vinnie.'

732
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:43,029
Hmm.

733
00:36:12,696 --> 00:36:14,070
Father, may I go along

734
00:36:14,154 --> 00:36:15,738
with the rest of you
to Delmonico's?

735
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:16,987
What's that? Delmonico's?

736
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,446
You're taking mother,
Cousin Cora

737
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:21,237
and Miss Skinner to Delmonico's
for dinner tonight.

738
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:23,070
Oh, God!

739
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:26,279
I won't have it.
I won't have it.

740
00:36:26,362 --> 00:36:29,112
I will not have my life
arranged for me.

741
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:30,863
I bought this house
for my own comfort.

742
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:33,070
I will not submit myself
to this indignity.

743
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:35,070
- Now, Clare, what's the matter?
- I won't stand it.

744
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,404
By heaven, I won't stand it!

745
00:36:36,487 --> 00:36:38,279
Clarence.

746
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:43,362
Do I understand
that I am not permitted

747
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:45,070
to have dinner in my own home?

748
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:49,362
Oh, Clare, a little change
will do you good.

749
00:36:49,446 --> 00:36:51,279
I have a home to have dinner in.

750
00:36:51,362 --> 00:36:53,321
And any time
I can't have dinner at home

751
00:36:53,404 --> 00:36:54,905
this house is for sale.

752
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,863
Well, Clare, you can't
have dinner here tonight

753
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,279
because it isn't ordered.

754
00:36:58,362 --> 00:37:00,654
And besides, Cora and Mary
want to see something

755
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:02,070
of New York.

756
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:04,821
Well, that's no affair of mine.

757
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:07,905
I am not a guide
to Chinatown and the Bowery.

758
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:15,613
Oh, Mr. Day,
I just love your house.

759
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:18,237
I could live here forever.

760
00:37:23,404 --> 00:37:25,362
Cora's waiting for you,
Mrs. Day.

761
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:27,821
Oh, yes. I'll run right up.

762
00:37:46,154 --> 00:37:49,446
I'm, uh, glad you like
our house, Miss Skinner.

763
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,029
I like it very much, Mr. Day.

764
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:55,487
Praise from a stranger
is approbation indeed.

765
00:37:55,571 --> 00:37:57,987
At home,
our living room is green.

766
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,654
I like green.

767
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:02,154
I like green too.

768
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:05,404
Red's my favorite color.

769
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,821
I-it's an interesting thing
about colors.

770
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,529
Red's a nice color
in a house, too

771
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:11,738
but outside too much red
would be bad.

772
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:14,112
I mean, for instance,
if all the trees

773
00:38:14,196 --> 00:38:15,654
and the grass were red.

774
00:38:15,738 --> 00:38:17,863
Outside, green's the best color.

775
00:38:17,946 --> 00:38:20,196
That's right.

776
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:22,196
I never thought of it that way.

777
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:25,321
But when you do think of it,
it's quite a thought.

778
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:28,529
I bet you'll make your mark
at Yale.

779
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:29,529
Oh.

780
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:31,362
My mother
wants me to go to college.

781
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:33,863
Do you believe
in girls going to college?

782
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:37,237
I guess it's alright if
they wanna waste that much time

783
00:38:37,321 --> 00:38:39,529
before they get married,
I mean.

784
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:43,987
I'm glad you're fond of music,
Mr. Day.

785
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:47,529
Oh, hello.
Look, a new "Youth's Companion."

786
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:50,821
John enjoys
"The Youth's Companion."

787
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,696
- John.
- Oh.

788
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:57,154
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh.

789
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,863
Oh, thank you.

790
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,571
It tells all about
connecting batteries in series.

791
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,487
John, Miss Skinner and I
were talking.

792
00:39:05,571 --> 00:39:07,779
Oh, that's alright.
You won't bother me.

793
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:09,654
Jiminy, there's where
I made my mistake.

794
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,987
- I didn't mix enough--
- Shh!

795
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,987
- Oh, don't stop.
- Can you play that?

796
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,571
I'm afraid not.
Can you play "Sweet Genevieve?"

797
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,946
- That's my favorite.
- Not without my music.

798
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,279
Hymns are nice, don't you think?

799
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:29,487
I like this one.

800
00:39:38,362 --> 00:39:40,112
That's funny.

801
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:42,946
The words are the same,
but it's the wrong tune.

802
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,279
Oh, it can't be the wrong tune.

803
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,571
We sing it exactly that way
in church.

804
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:49,738
We don't sing it that way
in the Methodist church.

805
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,446
- You see, we're Methodists.
- 'Oh, that's too bad.'

806
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:55,613
Oh, I-I don't mean it's too bad
that you're a Methodist.

807
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,654
Anybody's got a right to be
anything they want.

808
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,946
But what I mean is..

809
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:02,154
...we're Episcopalians.

810
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,696
Yes, I know.

811
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:12,738
Anyway, the words are the same.
Shall we begin?

812
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:20,154
Now.

813
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:36,987
- Oh, dear.
- What's wrong?

814
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:40,070
Shall we try again?

815
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,487
- It must be my fault.
- 'Oh, no, it's my fault.'

816
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:55,196
No, you're the Episcopalian.

817
00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:02,237
I just remembered something.

818
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,362
My father was an Episcopalian.

819
00:41:04,446 --> 00:41:06,863
He was baptized an Episcopalian.

820
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:08,987
He was an Episcopalian
right up to the time

821
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,029
he married my mother.

822
00:41:12,112 --> 00:41:15,779
- She was the Methodist.
- Oh.

823
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:19,154
Oh, well,
let's try it again then.

824
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,863
Well, Clarence,
if you're going to Delmonico's

825
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:27,112
with us,
you'd better get dressed.

826
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,487
Am I going too? Jiminy!

827
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,863
Thank you, father.

828
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:36,196
Be ready in just a minute,
mother.

829
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:41,362
Vinnie, that young lady looks
about the same age you were

830
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:43,821
when I came out to Pleasantville
to rescue you.

831
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:45,112
- Rescue me?
- Mmm.

832
00:41:45,196 --> 00:41:47,529
You came out there
to talk me into marrying you.

833
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:49,571
Well, it worked out
just the same.

834
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:34,613
- French.
- Oui.

835
00:42:34,696 --> 00:42:36,112
No cooking like the French.

836
00:42:36,196 --> 00:42:37,905
Clare, it was so nice of you
to invite

837
00:42:37,987 --> 00:42:39,446
Cora and Mary here
their first night.

838
00:42:39,529 --> 00:42:41,446
Well, it's been a pleasure.

839
00:42:41,529 --> 00:42:45,070
Mr. Day, have you always
been an Episcopalian?

840
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:48,529
I've always gone
to the Episcopal Church, yes.

841
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:51,070
But you weren't baptized
a Methodist or anything

842
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,821
were you?

843
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,112
You were baptized
an Episcopalian?

844
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,237
Come to think of it,
I don't believe

845
00:42:58,321 --> 00:42:59,946
I was ever baptized at all.

846
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:02,112
Clare, that's not very funny

847
00:43:02,196 --> 00:43:03,905
joking about a subject
like that.

848
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:05,613
I'm not joking.

849
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:07,487
I remember now.
I never was baptized.

850
00:43:07,571 --> 00:43:10,321
Clare, that's ridiculous.
Everybody's baptized.

851
00:43:10,404 --> 00:43:11,905
Well, I'm not.

852
00:43:11,987 --> 00:43:15,362
No one would keep a little baby
from being baptized.

853
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:16,738
Well, you know
father and mother.

854
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:18,821
Free thinkers, both of them.

855
00:43:18,905 --> 00:43:20,404
They thought
their children should decide

856
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:22,446
those things for themselves.

857
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:23,613
But, Clare--

858
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,237
I remember when I was, uh

859
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:27,279
ten or twelve years old

860
00:43:27,362 --> 00:43:29,821
mother said I ought to give
some thought to it, but, uh

861
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:31,946
'I never got around
to having it done to me.'

862
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:34,279
Clare, do you know
what you're saying?

863
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,905
Yes, I'm saying
I've never been baptized.

864
00:43:36,987 --> 00:43:39,613
Then something's got to be done
about it right away.

865
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:42,571
Now, Vinnie, don't get
excited over nothing.

866
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:44,821
Why haven't you ever told me?

867
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:46,487
Well, what difference
does it make?

868
00:43:46,571 --> 00:43:49,696
I have never heard of anyone
who wasn't baptized.

869
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:52,446
Even the savages
in darkest Africa.

870
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:56,321
Well, it's alright
for savages and children.

871
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:58,279
But if an oversight
was made in my case

872
00:43:58,362 --> 00:43:59,905
it's too late to correct it now.

873
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:17,821
Well, if you're not baptized,
you're not a Christian.

874
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,654
Why, confound it,
of course, I'm a Christian.

875
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:21,487
A mighty good Christian too.

876
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:24,196
A lot better Christian than
those psalm singers in church.

877
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:26,696
But you can't be
if you won't be baptized.

878
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:29,029
I won't be baptized
and I will be a Christian.

879
00:44:29,112 --> 00:44:30,905
I'll be a Christian
in my own way.

880
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:37,738
Clare, don't you want
to meet us all in heaven?

881
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:39,404
'Of course, and I'm going to.'

882
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:40,738
'But you can't go to heaven'

883
00:44:40,821 --> 00:44:42,112
'if you're not baptized.'

884
00:44:42,196 --> 00:44:45,112
'Oh, that's a lot of folderol.'

885
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:49,571
Clarence Day,
don't you blaspheme like that.

886
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,905
You're coming to church with me
before you go to the office

887
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:54,404
in the morning
and be baptized then and there.

888
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:56,154
Vinnie, don't be ridiculous.

889
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:58,738
If you think I'm going
to stand there and let Dr. Lloyd

890
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,279
splash water on me at my age,
you're mistaken.

891
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,946
Now I'm sleepy.
Goodnight, Vinnie.

892
00:45:27,446 --> 00:45:29,779
Mother, what is folderol?

893
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:32,237
Get back to sleep.

894
00:45:32,321 --> 00:45:33,779
- Mother?
- Yes, Whitney.

895
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,696
If father hasn't been baptized

896
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,279
he hasn't any name.

897
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:40,404
In the sight of the church,
he hasn't any name.

898
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,946
That's right.

899
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:46,446
Maybe we're not even married.

900
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:55,571
We, Thine unworthy servants

901
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:58,487
do give Thee
most humble and hearty thanks

902
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:00,779
for all Thy goodness
and loving kindness

903
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:03,529
to us and to all men.

904
00:46:03,613 --> 00:46:07,987
We bless Thee
for our creation, preservation

905
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,696
and all the blessings
of this life.

906
00:46:10,779 --> 00:46:14,029
'But above all,
for Thine inestimable love'

907
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:19,154
'in the redemption of the world
by our Lord Jesus Christ'

908
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:23,404
'for the means of grace,
for the hope of glory.'

909
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,779
'And we beseech Thee'

910
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:29,237
'give us that due sense
of all Thy mercies'

911
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:31,321
'that our hearts
may be unfeignedly..'

912
00:46:31,404 --> 00:46:35,029
Harlan, tell Clarence to kneel.

913
00:46:35,112 --> 00:46:39,696
Whitney, tell Clarence to kneel.

914
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:42,571
John, tell Clarence to kneel.

915
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:46,154
Mother says kneel.

916
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:52,529
He says he can't.

917
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:55,654
He says he can't.

918
00:46:55,738 --> 00:46:57,696
He says he can't.

919
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,029
'...world without end.'

920
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:00,362
'Amen.'

921
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:02,404
Amen.

922
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,196
The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ

923
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,821
and the love of God

924
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:09,404
and the Fellowship
of the Holy Ghost

925
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:11,446
be with us all evermore.

926
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,112
- 'Amen.'
- Amen.

927
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:33,112
And so, my friends

928
00:47:33,196 --> 00:47:35,946
what comfort and security
it gives us

929
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:38,863
when we have reached
the age of understanding

930
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:41,905
'to know
that the rite of baptism'

931
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:45,905
has not been neglected
in our infancy or youth.

932
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:49,446
Can you imagine any man

933
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:51,321
who has reached maturity

934
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:55,279
with the knowledge
that he had never been baptized

935
00:47:55,362 --> 00:47:57,738
failing to hasten
to the holy font

936
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,946
that his soul might be saved?

937
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:04,279
'As it says
in the baptismal office'

938
00:48:04,362 --> 00:48:08,863
'"Except a man be born of water
and of the spirit'

939
00:48:08,946 --> 00:48:12,654
'he cannot enter
into the kingdom of God."'

940
00:48:12,738 --> 00:48:14,487
'"He that believeth'

941
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:18,654
"and is baptized
shall be saved

942
00:48:18,738 --> 00:48:23,112
but he that believeth not
shall be damned."

943
00:48:23,196 --> 00:48:25,237
What's that fellow up to?
He can't be..

944
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:28,696
'Which also showeth us
the great benefit we reap..'

945
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:30,571
Tell father shh.

946
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:34,029
Tell father shh.

947
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:36,112
Tell father shh.

948
00:48:36,196 --> 00:48:39,070
Tell father shh.

949
00:48:39,154 --> 00:48:41,154
Mother says shh.

950
00:48:41,237 --> 00:48:44,905
'"For the promise is to you'

951
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:47,446
'"and to your children.'

952
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:49,987
'"Doubt ye not therefore'

953
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,613
but earnestly believe."

954
00:48:57,863 --> 00:48:59,821
In the name of the father
and of the Son

955
00:48:59,905 --> 00:49:02,487
and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

956
00:49:02,571 --> 00:49:04,404
Amen.

957
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:36,446
This is
William Tyler Wickersham.

958
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:39,279
And this is
Wilhelmina Eugenia Wickersham.

959
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:42,196
'What a lovely day
for them to be baptized.'

960
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,779
'The happiest day in my life.'

961
00:49:49,863 --> 00:49:52,613
- Lovely sermon.
- Thank you, Mrs. Day.

962
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:03,154
Clare, you know I didn't ask
Dr. Lloyd to do that.

963
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:04,571
You must have said something.

964
00:50:04,654 --> 00:50:06,196
Well, I had to find out from him

965
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:07,571
if we were really married.

966
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:09,613
I am married
and I'm not baptized.

967
00:50:09,696 --> 00:50:10,696
And as far as I'm concerned

968
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:12,487
the whole congregation
can know it.

969
00:50:12,571 --> 00:50:15,237
- They certainly know it now.
- That suits me.

970
00:50:15,321 --> 00:50:16,738
I don't go to church
to be preached at

971
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:18,529
as though I were
some lost sheep.

972
00:50:18,613 --> 00:50:20,196
Clare, you don't seem
to understand

973
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:21,738
what the church is for.

974
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,237
Vinnie, if there's one place
the church should leave alone

975
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,112
it's a man's soul.

976
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,987
Well, he's going to be baptized,
Cora, you mark my word.

977
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,613
I just couldn't go to heaven
without Clare.

978
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:43,613
Why, I get lonesome for him
even when I go to Ohio.

979
00:50:43,696 --> 00:50:46,987
It's awfully hard on a woman to
love a man like Clare so much.

980
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,987
Oh, men are so aggravating.

981
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,987
They take everything
for granted.

982
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,237
They certainly do.

983
00:50:53,321 --> 00:50:55,696
You know, I don't believe
Clare's come right out

984
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:58,112
and told me he loves me
since we've been married.

985
00:50:58,196 --> 00:50:59,321
Of course, I know he does

986
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:01,362
because I keep reminding him
of it.

987
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:03,613
You have to keep
reminding them, Cora.

988
00:51:03,696 --> 00:51:06,696
'Vinnie, the table isn't set
for dinner yet.'

989
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:11,362
I'll be back in a minute, Cora.

990
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,905
We're having it after Cora
and Mary go to the train.

991
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,446
Their cab is coming
at 1 o'clock.

992
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:17,905
'Cab? The horse cars
go right past the door.'

993
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,779
But, Clare,
they have those heavy bags.

994
00:51:20,863 --> 00:51:22,404
Cabs are a waste of money.

995
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:23,946
Well, if dinner's going
to be delayed

996
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:25,779
I'll work on this month's bills.
Where are they?

997
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,613
Now, Clare, it isn't fair to go
over the household accounts

998
00:51:28,696 --> 00:51:29,987
when you're hungry.

999
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,987
Vinnie, where are those bills?

1000
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:34,154
They're in the library
on your desk.

1001
00:51:34,237 --> 00:51:35,571
Hmm.

1002
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:37,529
I didn't know
dinner was going to be late.

1003
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,279
No one ever tells me
anything in this house.

1004
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,321
Back home I ride all the time.
I love horses.

1005
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:44,362
The horse is my favorite animal.

1006
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:46,321
Well, goodness,
where have you two been?

1007
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,613
Clarence wanted to show me
his grandfather's house.

1008
00:51:48,696 --> 00:51:51,112
You will have to hurry
and finish your packing.

1009
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:53,154
- It won't take me long.
- Can I help you pack?

1010
00:51:53,237 --> 00:51:54,863
Clarence.

1011
00:51:57,487 --> 00:51:59,821
Clarence..

1012
00:51:59,905 --> 00:52:02,696
...why didn't you kneel
in church today?

1013
00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:05,404
I, I just couldn't.

1014
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:10,029
If it's because
your father doesn't kneel

1015
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:13,112
you must remember he wasn't
brought up to kneel in church.

1016
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,696
But you were.

1017
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:18,196
Has it anything to do with Mary?

1018
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:20,529
- I know she's a Methodist.
- Oh, no, mother.

1019
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:22,362
Methodists kneel.
Mary told me.

1020
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:23,821
They don't get up and down
so much

1021
00:52:23,905 --> 00:52:25,863
but they stay down longer.

1022
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:29,529
Clarence, you want to kneel,
don't you?

1023
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,321
Oh, yes.
I wanted to kneel today.

1024
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:33,196
I-I tried. You saw me try.

1025
00:52:33,279 --> 00:52:36,196
But...I just couldn't.

1026
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:39,321
Well, is that suit of your
father's too tight for you?

1027
00:52:39,404 --> 00:52:42,654
- No, it's not too tight.
- Well, what is it?

1028
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:45,154
Mother, very peculiar things
have happened to me

1029
00:52:45,237 --> 00:52:47,362
since I started to wear
this suit.

1030
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:49,696
I can't seem
to make these clothes

1031
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,613
do anything father wouldn't do.

1032
00:52:51,696 --> 00:52:53,987
Oh, that's nonsense, Clarence.

1033
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,279
And not to kneel in church
is a sacrilege.

1034
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:59,654
Making father's trousers kneel
seemed more of a sacrilege.

1035
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:00,987
Clarence.

1036
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,863
Do you know what happened
at Dura Wakefield's party

1037
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:03,946
for Mary last night?

1038
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:05,237
We were playing musical chairs

1039
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:07,154
and some girl sat down
suddenly right in my lap.

1040
00:53:07,237 --> 00:53:10,237
Well, I jumped up so fast,
she almost got hurt.

1041
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:13,613
She was sitting
on father's trousers.

1042
00:53:13,696 --> 00:53:16,237
Well, mother, I've got
to have a suit of my own.

1043
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,237
My soul and body.

1044
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,446
Well, you'll just have to talk
to your father about it.

1045
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:23,738
I'm sure if you approach him
the right way

1046
00:53:23,821 --> 00:53:25,946
you know, tactfully, he'll see.

1047
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:27,613
Oh, excuse me.

1048
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:32,613
Gracious.
It didn't take you very long.

1049
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:37,487
Well, I'll see about
your box lunch for the train.

1050
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:42,279
Remember, it's Sunday.

1051
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:50,404
I, I was hoping we could have

1052
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:52,987
a few minutes together
before you left.

1053
00:53:55,821 --> 00:53:59,112
Cora had so much to do.
I wanted to get out of her way.

1054
00:53:59,196 --> 00:54:02,112
Well, didn't you wanna see me?

1055
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:06,987
I did want to tell you how much
I've enjoyed our...friendship.

1056
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,613
Oh, hello.
Mother told us to sit

1057
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,196
in the living room
till dinner's ready.

1058
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:15,446
- Not on the best sofa.
- Hello.

1059
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:16,905
Hello.

1060
00:54:18,613 --> 00:54:20,112
Have you ever been out
on our porch?

1061
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:22,696
- Oh, yes.
- Well, let me show it to you.

1062
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:27,987
It's awfully hard to grow up
in a family with children.

1063
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,987
My, I've never known a week
to pass so quickly.

1064
00:54:35,321 --> 00:54:37,738
- Why, I..
- Yes?

1065
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:40,863
- Why, I..
- Yes?

1066
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:42,154
You're going to write me

1067
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,529
when you get to Springfield,
aren't you?

1068
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,154
Of course,
if you write me first.

1069
00:54:46,237 --> 00:54:47,946
But you'll have something
to write about.

1070
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:49,154
Your trip, and Aunt Judith

1071
00:54:49,237 --> 00:54:50,821
and how things are
in Springfield.

1072
00:54:50,905 --> 00:54:53,529
You write me
as soon as you get there.

1073
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,362
Maybe I'll be too busy.

1074
00:54:56,446 --> 00:54:58,571
Maybe I won't have time.

1075
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:00,196
Well, you find the time.

1076
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:02,196
Let's not have any nonsense
about that.

1077
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,279
You'll write me first,
and you'll do it right away

1078
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:05,987
the first day.

1079
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,863
How do you know
I'll take orders from you?

1080
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:12,571
Well, I'll show you.

1081
00:55:12,654 --> 00:55:14,905
- Give me your hand.
- Why should I?

1082
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:16,571
Give me your hand, confound it!

1083
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:18,821
What do you want with my hand?

1084
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:22,279
I just wanted it.

1085
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:28,154
What are you thinking about?

1086
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:29,613
I was just thinking.

1087
00:55:29,696 --> 00:55:31,362
About what?

1088
00:55:31,446 --> 00:55:33,362
I was hoping
you'd write me first

1089
00:55:33,446 --> 00:55:35,112
because that would mean
you liked me.

1090
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:38,070
What's my writing first
got to do with liking you?

1091
00:55:38,154 --> 00:55:41,029
Oh, you do like me then?

1092
00:55:41,112 --> 00:55:42,237
Of course, I do.

1093
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,154
I like you better
than any girl I ever met.

1094
00:55:49,154 --> 00:55:51,571
But you don't like me
well enough to write first?

1095
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,154
Well, I don't see
how one thing's

1096
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:54,571
got anything to do
with the other.

1097
00:55:54,654 --> 00:55:57,154
But a girl can't write first
because..

1098
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,446
...because she's a girl.

1099
00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:02,905
Well, that's nonsense. If a girl
has something to write about

1100
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,654
and a fellow hasn't,
there's no reason

1101
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:06,779
why she shouldn't write first.

1102
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,905
You know,
the first three days I was here

1103
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:10,863
you'd do anything for me.

1104
00:56:10,946 --> 00:56:12,863
And then you changed.

1105
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:14,654
You used to be a lot of fun.

1106
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:18,196
Then all of a sudden, you turned
into an old sobersides.

1107
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:21,487
Why, why, you even dress
like an old sobersides.

1108
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:26,279
What's the matter?

1109
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:28,613
I just happened
to remember something.

1110
00:56:28,696 --> 00:56:30,154
What?

1111
00:56:30,237 --> 00:56:31,779
Oh, I know.

1112
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:33,613
It's because
this is the last time

1113
00:56:33,696 --> 00:56:34,946
we'll be together.

1114
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:36,112
Mary, please.

1115
00:56:36,196 --> 00:56:37,946
But, Clarence,
we'll see each other

1116
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,529
in a month when I come back.

1117
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:43,029
Oh, Clarence,
please write me first

1118
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:46,279
because that will show me
how much you like me.

1119
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:47,905
Please?

1120
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,487
I'll show you
how much I like you.

1121
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:58,446
- Get up. Get up!
- Ah.

1122
00:56:58,529 --> 00:56:59,613
Oh. Oh!

1123
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:00,905
Oh, Mary, don't do that.

1124
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:02,487
Please, don't do that!

1125
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:03,821
Now you'll think

1126
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:06,446
I'm just a bold
and forward girl.

1127
00:57:06,529 --> 00:57:08,821
Oh, no. No, it's not that.

1128
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,487
Was it because it's Sunday?

1129
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:14,654
No, it'd be the same any day.

1130
00:57:14,738 --> 00:57:18,362
Oh! You just didn't want me
sitting on your lap.

1131
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:19,696
Oh, it was nice of you to do it.

1132
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:21,446
It was nice of me

1133
00:57:21,529 --> 00:57:22,987
so you told me to get up?

1134
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,196
You just couldn't bear
to have me sit there.

1135
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:27,196
Oh, and you needn't write me
first.

1136
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:29,654
You needn't write me
any letters at all.

1137
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,821
Because I'll tear them up
without opening them.

1138
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:35,863
I never want to see you again.

1139
00:57:35,946 --> 00:57:39,487
Oh, Mary. Mary, listen to me,
Mary, please.

1140
00:57:39,571 --> 00:57:40,987
Oh, Mary.

1141
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:54,237
Clarence.

1142
00:57:56,779 --> 00:57:58,362
Yes, father?

1143
00:57:58,446 --> 00:58:01,613
That young lady's crying.
She's in tears.

1144
00:58:01,696 --> 00:58:03,112
What's the meaning of this?

1145
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:05,487
I'm sorry, father.
It's all my fault.

1146
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:08,237
Nonsense. What's that girl
trying to do to you?

1147
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,112
Oh, n-no, no, she wasn't.

1148
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:11,863
It was.. I, I..

1149
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:14,905
Well, whatever the quarrel
was about, Clarence

1150
00:58:14,987 --> 00:58:17,029
I'm glad you held your own.

1151
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:20,237
Father, I have to have
a new suit of clothes!

1152
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:22,529
You've got to give me
the money for it!

1153
00:58:24,487 --> 00:58:27,279
Young man, do you realize that
you're addressing your father?

1154
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:32,487
I'm sorry, father.
I apologize.

1155
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:35,237
But you don't know
how important this is to me.

1156
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:38,279
A new suit of clothes
is so impor..

1157
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:39,946
Oh, why should..

1158
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:45,529
Clarence, has your need
for a new suit of clothes

1159
00:58:45,613 --> 00:58:48,321
anything to do
with that young lady?

1160
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:49,946
Yes, father.

1161
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,738
Why, Clarence.

1162
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,821
Oh.

1163
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:56,905
Why, this comes
as quite a shock to me.

1164
00:58:56,987 --> 00:58:58,613
What does, father?

1165
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:01,196
Well,
you're being so...grownup.

1166
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:04,154
Still, I might have known.

1167
00:59:04,237 --> 00:59:06,987
If you are going to college
this fall..

1168
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:09,863
Yes, you're at the age
when you'll be meeting girls.

1169
00:59:12,404 --> 00:59:15,112
Clarence, there are things
about women

1170
00:59:15,196 --> 00:59:18,112
that I think you ought to know.

1171
00:59:18,196 --> 00:59:20,404
Sit down.

1172
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:39,154
Yes, I think it's better for you
to hear this from me

1173
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:41,571
than to have to learn it
for yourself.

1174
00:59:44,154 --> 00:59:46,154
Clarence..

1175
00:59:46,237 --> 00:59:49,863
...women aren't the angels
that you think they are.

1176
00:59:49,946 --> 00:59:53,279
Well, now first,
let me explain this to you.

1177
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:56,738
You see, Clarence,
we men have to run this world

1178
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:58,821
and it's not an easy job.

1179
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:01,987
It takes work
and it takes thinking.

1180
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,654
A man has to reason things out.

1181
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,654
Now you take a woman.

1182
01:00:06,738 --> 01:00:09,112
A woman thinks..

1183
01:00:09,196 --> 01:00:11,738
No, I'm wrong right there.

1184
01:00:11,821 --> 01:00:13,987
A woman doesn't think at all.

1185
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,821
She gets stirred up.

1186
01:00:15,905 --> 01:00:19,613
And she gets stirred up
over the most confounded things.

1187
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,154
Now I love my wife
just as much as any man

1188
01:00:22,237 --> 01:00:23,821
but that doesn't mean
that I should stand

1189
01:00:23,905 --> 01:00:26,237
for a lot of folderol.

1190
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:27,821
By God, I won't stand for it!

1191
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:29,196
Stand for what, father?

1192
01:00:29,279 --> 01:00:32,779
That's the one thing
I shall not submit myself to.

1193
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:36,362
Clarence, if a man thinks
a certain thing is wrong

1194
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,571
he shouldn't do it.

1195
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:40,362
If he thinks it's right,
he should do it.

1196
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:41,613
Now that has nothing to do with

1197
01:00:41,696 --> 01:00:43,279
whether he loves his wife
or not.

1198
01:00:43,362 --> 01:00:45,529
- Who says it has, father?
- They do.

1199
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:47,196
- Who, sir?
- Women.

1200
01:00:47,279 --> 01:00:48,654
They get stirred up

1201
01:00:48,738 --> 01:00:50,863
and then they try
to get you stirred up too.

1202
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:52,446
But don't you let them do it,
Clarence.

1203
01:00:52,529 --> 01:00:54,404
Don't you let them do it.

1204
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:57,529
Now, if you can keep reason
and logic in the argument

1205
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:00,863
well, a man can hold his own,
of course.

1206
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:02,987
But if they can switch you

1207
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:06,237
pretty soon the argument's about
whether you love them or not.

1208
01:01:06,321 --> 01:01:08,905
I swear,
I don't know how they do it.

1209
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:10,613
But don't you let them,
Clarence.

1210
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:12,070
Don't you let them.

1211
01:01:12,154 --> 01:01:14,487
I see what you mean so far,
father.

1212
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:16,863
If you don't watch yourself,
love can make you do

1213
01:01:16,946 --> 01:01:18,362
a lot of things
you don't wanna do.

1214
01:01:18,446 --> 01:01:19,362
'Exactly.'

1215
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:20,571
But if you do watch out

1216
01:01:20,654 --> 01:01:22,613
and know
just how to handle women..

1217
01:01:22,696 --> 01:01:24,696
Then you'll be alright.

1218
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:28,237
All a man has to do is be firm.

1219
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:32,738
You know how sometimes I have
to be firm with your mother.

1220
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:36,529
Yes, but, father,
what can you do when they cry?

1221
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:40,070
Hmm.

1222
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:42,987
Well, uh,
that's quite a question.

1223
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:46,112
You just have to
make them understand

1224
01:01:46,196 --> 01:01:49,321
that what you're doing
is for their good.

1225
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:50,571
I see.

1226
01:01:50,654 --> 01:01:53,237
Now, Clarence,
you know all about women.

1227
01:02:00,404 --> 01:02:03,279
- But, father.
- Yes, Clarence?

1228
01:02:03,362 --> 01:02:05,446
I thought you were going
to tell me about..

1229
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:08,321
- About what?
- About women.

1230
01:02:11,196 --> 01:02:14,946
Clarence, there are some things
gentlemen don't discuss.

1231
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:17,404
I've told you
all you need to know.

1232
01:02:17,487 --> 01:02:20,487
The thing for you to remember
is be firm.

1233
01:02:49,905 --> 01:02:51,821
Mary,
when you get to Springfield

1234
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,112
the very first thing you..

1235
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:05,029
Oh, God!

1236
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:07,613
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1237
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:09,112
Sit down, Vinnie.

1238
01:03:09,196 --> 01:03:11,070
Oh, Clare, Cora and Mary
are leaving any moment now.

1239
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:13,279
Sit down.

1240
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:17,321
Vinnie,
you know I like to live well

1241
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:19,529
and I want my family
to live well.

1242
01:03:19,613 --> 01:03:21,779
But this house must be run
on a business basis.

1243
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:25,529
I must know how much money
I'm spending and what for.

1244
01:03:25,613 --> 01:03:27,654
For instance,
if you recall, a week ago

1245
01:03:27,738 --> 01:03:30,404
I gave you $6
to buy a new coffee pot.

1246
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:32,029
Yes,
because you broke the old one.

1247
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,946
You threw it right on the floor.

1248
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:36,237
I'm not talking about that.
Now I find here among my--

1249
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:39,029
It was a pity to break
that nice coffee pot, Clare.

1250
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:40,529
It was imported from France.

1251
01:03:40,613 --> 01:03:42,487
And that little shop
has stopped selling them.

1252
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:44,237
They said the tariff
wouldn't let them.

1253
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,946
And that's your fault
because you're always voting

1254
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:48,196
to raise the tariff.

1255
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:49,487
The tariff protects America

1256
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:51,946
against cheap foreign labor.
Now this bill--

1257
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,404
The tariff does nothing
but put up the prices

1258
01:03:55,487 --> 01:03:58,738
and that's hard on everybody
especially the farmer.

1259
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:00,905
Vinnie, I wish to heaven
you wouldn't talk about matters

1260
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:02,446
you don't know anything about.

1261
01:04:02,529 --> 01:04:04,987
I do, too, know about them.
Miss Guelig says

1262
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:07,154
that every intelligent woman
should have some opinion--

1263
01:04:07,237 --> 01:04:09,029
Who may I ask is Miss Guelig?

1264
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,112
She's the current events woman
I told you about.

1265
01:04:11,196 --> 01:04:14,237
And the tickets are a dollar
every Tuesday.

1266
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,112
Do you mean to tell me that
a pack of idle-minded females

1267
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:19,279
pay a dollar apiece
to hear another female

1268
01:04:19,362 --> 01:04:21,112
gabble about
the events of the day?

1269
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:22,529
Listen to me
if you want to know anything

1270
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:23,571
about the events of the day.

1271
01:04:23,654 --> 01:04:26,404
But you get so excited, Clare.

1272
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:29,362
And besides, Miss Guelig says
that our President

1273
01:04:29,446 --> 01:04:32,571
whom you're always belittling,
prays to God for guidance.

1274
01:04:32,654 --> 01:04:35,029
Vinnie,
what happened to that $6?

1275
01:04:35,112 --> 01:04:37,070
What $6?

1276
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,446
I gave you $6
to buy a new coffee pot.

1277
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:44,321
Now I find that
you apparently got one

1278
01:04:44,404 --> 01:04:45,946
at Lewis & Congers
and charged it.

1279
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:49,321
Here's their bill.
"One coffee pot, $5."

1280
01:04:49,404 --> 01:04:52,654
So you owe me a dollar,
and you can hand it right over.

1281
01:04:52,738 --> 01:04:54,654
I'll do nothing of the kind.

1282
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:56,905
What did you do with that $6?

1283
01:04:56,987 --> 01:04:59,946
Well, Clare,
I can't tell you now, dear.

1284
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,112
Why didn't you ask me
at the time?

1285
01:05:03,196 --> 01:05:06,404
I give up.

1286
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:08,070
Oh, wait a minute.

1287
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,404
I spent $4.50
for that new umbrella.

1288
01:05:11,487 --> 01:05:13,321
Now we're getting somewhere.

1289
01:05:13,404 --> 01:05:15,196
One umbrella, $4.50.

1290
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,362
And that must have been the week
I paid Mrs. Tobin

1291
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:18,779
for two extra days' washing.

1292
01:05:18,863 --> 01:05:21,446
- Mrs. Tobin.
- That's $2 more.

1293
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:23,738
- Two dollars.
- That makes, that makes up..

1294
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:25,196
$6.50.

1295
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:27,446
And that's another 50 cents
you owe me.

1296
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:28,905
I don't owe you anything.

1297
01:05:28,987 --> 01:05:30,321
What you owe me
is an explanation

1298
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:31,905
of where my money is gone.

1299
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:34,987
I do the best I can
to keep down expenses.

1300
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:38,362
You know yourself, Cousin Phoebe
spends twice as much as we do.

1301
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:40,196
Don't talk to me
about your cousin Phoebe.

1302
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:42,987
Oh, you talk about
your own relatives enough.

1303
01:05:44,446 --> 01:05:45,905
That's not fair, Vinnie.

1304
01:05:45,987 --> 01:05:49,821
When I talk about my relatives,
I criticize them.

1305
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,696
I can't even speak
of Cousin Phoebe.

1306
01:05:51,779 --> 01:05:53,529
'You can speak of her
all you want to.'

1307
01:05:53,613 --> 01:05:55,821
'But I won't have Cousin Phoebe
or anyone else'

1308
01:05:55,905 --> 01:05:57,987
'dictating to me
how to run my house.'

1309
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,029
I didn't say a word
about her dictating.

1310
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:02,905
'Clare,
you know she isn't that--'

1311
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:05,362
You said, you said..

1312
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:09,029
I don't know what you said now.

1313
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:11,029
You never stick to the point.

1314
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:15,654
Now, we're going over this
account book item by item.

1315
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:19,196
I find here a bill for $38.

1316
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:21,946
I don't know
what you expect of me.

1317
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:24,196
I tire myself out
chasing up and down

1318
01:06:24,279 --> 01:06:26,070
those stairs all day long

1319
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:28,362
trying to look after
your comfort

1320
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:30,529
to bring up our children.

1321
01:06:30,613 --> 01:06:33,362
I do the mending
and the marketing.

1322
01:06:33,446 --> 01:06:36,362
Now you want me to be
an expert bookkeeper too.

1323
01:06:47,696 --> 01:06:51,571
Vinnie,
I want to be reasonable, but..

1324
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:55,987
Can't you understand? I'm doing
all this for your own good.

1325
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:57,529
Oh.

1326
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:04,362
Well, I suppose I'll have to
go ahead just paying the bills

1327
01:07:04,446 --> 01:07:07,821
and hoping I've got enough money
in the bank to meet them.

1328
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:10,237
But it's all very discouraging.

1329
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:14,529
I'll try to do better, Clare.

1330
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,821
Well, that's all I'm asking.

1331
01:07:18,987 --> 01:07:21,779
Well, I'll, uh, make out
the checks and sign them.

1332
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:27,070
But, uh, ahem, maybe I haven't
any right to sign those checks

1333
01:07:27,154 --> 01:07:30,446
since in the sight of the Lord,
I haven't any name.

1334
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:31,946
That's right.

1335
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:33,404
Clare, to make those checks good

1336
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:36,112
you'll have to be baptized
right away.

1337
01:07:36,196 --> 01:07:37,571
Vinnie, the bank doesn't care

1338
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,446
whether I've been baptized
or not.

1339
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:40,905
Well, I care.

1340
01:07:40,987 --> 01:07:42,654
And no matter
what Dr. Lloyd said

1341
01:07:42,738 --> 01:07:45,446
I'm not sure
we're really married.

1342
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:47,112
Vinnie, we have four children.

1343
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:50,029
If we're not married now,
we never will be.

1344
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,029
Clare, Dr. Lloyd said
this morning--

1345
01:07:52,112 --> 01:07:53,779
Well, that's all, Vinnie.

1346
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:57,279
Uh, I think you better go tell
Whitney to watch for the cab.

1347
01:07:57,362 --> 01:08:00,154
Not before you give me
that $1.50.

1348
01:08:00,237 --> 01:08:03,112
- What $1.50?
- That $1.50 you owe me.

1349
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:05,613
I don't owe you any $1.50.

1350
01:08:05,696 --> 01:08:07,779
I gave you money
to buy a coffee pot for me

1351
01:08:07,863 --> 01:08:10,154
and somehow it turned
into an umbrella for you.

1352
01:08:10,237 --> 01:08:13,362
Why, Clarence Day,
what kind of man are you?

1353
01:08:13,446 --> 01:08:15,987
Quibbling about $1.50
when your immortal soul

1354
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,237
is in danger.

1355
01:08:17,321 --> 01:08:19,571
- And what's more, if you--
- Alright.

1356
01:08:19,654 --> 01:08:22,237
Alright, alright.

1357
01:08:22,321 --> 01:08:23,613
Hmm.

1358
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:27,696
Thank you, Clare.

1359
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:30,321
Now the accounts
are all straight again.

1360
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,362
What were you doing down there?

1361
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:54,029
I'm setting up
this new burglar alarm.

1362
01:08:54,112 --> 01:08:55,487
I invented it myself.

1363
01:08:55,571 --> 01:08:56,987
Have you got any money
you can lend me?

1364
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,529
No, you owe me 30 cents now.

1365
01:08:58,613 --> 01:09:00,029
Well, I'll give you
my stamp collection

1366
01:09:00,112 --> 01:09:02,029
and my piece
of John Wilkes Booth's finger.

1367
01:09:02,112 --> 01:09:03,196
How much?

1368
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,738
Enough to get
a new suit of clothes.

1369
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,529
If you can wait a month till
I hear from the patent office

1370
01:09:06,613 --> 01:09:08,196
in Washington, I may be rich.

1371
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:11,154
- Oh, I can't wait that long.
- Maybe I could get it sooner.

1372
01:09:11,237 --> 01:09:13,696
I'm going to look
into something else tomorrow.

1373
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:18,696
"Wanted. An energetic young man
to sell household necessity.

1374
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,821
Liberal commission.
Apply 312.."

1375
01:09:20,905 --> 01:09:22,196
John, let me have this job.

1376
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:24,529
Why should I give you my job?
They're hard to get.

1377
01:09:24,613 --> 01:09:26,779
But I've got to get
a new suit of clothes.

1378
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,529
Maybe I could get the job
for both of us.

1379
01:09:28,613 --> 01:09:30,362
I'll ask the man.

1380
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:44,070
- The cab's here, father.
- Oh, t-thank you, Whitney.

1381
01:09:44,154 --> 01:09:46,696
Uh, Vinnie, Cora,
the cab's here!

1382
01:09:48,905 --> 01:09:51,404
Uh, John, uh,
go up and get their bags.

1383
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,946
Yes, sir.

1384
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:55,821
Here's the lunch
for the train, sir.

1385
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:58,237
Well, take it out to the cab.

1386
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,237
- Who's that one?
- It's Ellen.

1387
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:02,821
Delia left yesterday.

1388
01:10:02,905 --> 01:10:04,696
I don't know
where your mother finds them.

1389
01:10:04,779 --> 01:10:07,112
Now, Vinnie, don't you let
Clare worry about us.

1390
01:10:07,196 --> 01:10:08,237
We have plenty of time.

1391
01:10:08,321 --> 01:10:09,905
Oh, take the bags right on out,
John.

1392
01:10:09,987 --> 01:10:11,446
- Yes, sir.
- Well, goodbye, Clarence.

1393
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:12,863
It was so nice to see you again.

1394
01:10:12,987 --> 01:10:14,279
Goodbye, Cousin Cora.

1395
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:17,237
Goodbye, Whitney.
Now you be a good boy.

1396
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:19,237
- Goodbye, Cousin Cora.
- Goodbye, Harlan.

1397
01:10:19,321 --> 01:10:20,863
Goodbye.
Keep out of mischief.

1398
01:10:20,946 --> 01:10:22,654
Come along, everybody.
Don't keep the cab waiting.

1399
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:23,821
Cabs cost money.

1400
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:25,613
If there's one thing
Mr. Day can't stand

1401
01:10:25,696 --> 01:10:27,070
it's to keep a cab waiting.

1402
01:10:27,154 --> 01:10:28,779
If there's any waiting to do,
there's a waiting room

1403
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,112
at the Grand Central Depot
just for that.

1404
01:10:31,196 --> 01:10:33,279
Mary..

1405
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,446
...aren't you even going
to shake hands with me?

1406
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:36,987
I don't think I'd better.

1407
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,237
You may remember that
when I get too close to you

1408
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:40,821
you feel contaminated.

1409
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:44,654
Mary, you're going to write
to me, aren't you?

1410
01:10:44,738 --> 01:10:48,446
- Are you going to write first?
- No, Mary.

1411
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:51,112
There are times
when a man must be firm.

1412
01:10:51,196 --> 01:10:53,112
Mary, mother says
you better hurry out

1413
01:10:53,196 --> 01:10:54,779
before father starts yelling.

1414
01:10:54,863 --> 01:10:57,029
It's Sunday.

1415
01:10:57,112 --> 01:10:58,279
Goodbye, John.

1416
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:00,654
I'm very happy
to have made your acquaintance.

1417
01:11:00,738 --> 01:11:02,196
Thank you.

1418
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:06,654
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

1419
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:08,529
Take care of yourself.

1420
01:11:08,613 --> 01:11:10,362
- Goodbye, Mr. Day.
- Goodbye, Mary.

1421
01:11:10,446 --> 01:11:11,821
Bye, Mrs. Day.
I've had a wonderful time.

1422
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:13,529
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Thank you.

1423
01:11:13,613 --> 01:11:15,070
- 'Bye-bye.'
- 'Goodbye.'

1424
01:11:15,154 --> 01:11:17,279
- 'Goodbye, Cousin Clare.'
- Goodbye, Cora.

1425
01:11:17,362 --> 01:11:18,696
- Goodbye, Cora.
- 'Bye.'

1426
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,821
- Bye, Cousin Cora.
- Bye.

1427
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:23,196
- Bye!
- Bye!

1428
01:11:33,446 --> 01:11:37,196
Dear Mary..

1429
01:11:39,613 --> 01:11:42,029
"My duty toward my neighbor

1430
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:44,404
"is to love him as myself

1431
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:47,196
"and to do to all men

1432
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:49,779
as I would
they should do unto me."

1433
01:11:49,863 --> 01:11:52,112
Has father
gone to the office yet?

1434
01:11:52,196 --> 01:11:53,779
Come on,
let's go to the ball field.

1435
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:56,487
I've got to guard this box
till John comes back.

1436
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:57,696
It's his burglar alarm.

1437
01:11:57,779 --> 01:11:59,070
It wouldn't work so he fixed it.

1438
01:11:59,154 --> 01:12:00,863
We're going to put it back
in the dining room

1439
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,613
after father goes to the office.

1440
01:12:02,696 --> 01:12:04,321
Are there burglars around?

1441
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,571
- Everywhere.
- Oh.

1442
01:12:06,654 --> 01:12:09,613
"To love, honor, and succor
my father

1443
01:12:09,696 --> 01:12:10,779
and my mother--"

1444
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,571
Why do you have to learn that?

1445
01:12:12,654 --> 01:12:14,446
Because if I don't,
I'll go to hell.

1446
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,946
- Father's going to hell.
- He is not!

1447
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:19,154
Yes, he is,
because he isn't baptized.

1448
01:12:19,237 --> 01:12:21,571
He'll go to hell and burn
for a thousand years.

1449
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:23,446
He won't! He won't!

1450
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:25,404
He'll be in a lake
of fire and brimstone

1451
01:12:25,487 --> 01:12:27,112
and a thousand devils
with pitchforks

1452
01:12:27,196 --> 01:12:28,279
will be poking at him.

1453
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:29,779
- No! Mother, don't let--
- Shh.

1454
01:12:29,863 --> 01:12:31,613
- Father will hear you!
- No, I don't..

1455
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:39,613
'Don't smother me!'

1456
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,362
What's that noise?

1457
01:12:44,446 --> 01:12:46,738
- Just singing, father.
- 'You boys, be quiet.'

1458
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,571
You know your mother
isn't feeling well.

1459
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:50,446
'Yes, father.'

1460
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:01,779
What did your mother say?

1461
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:04,738
She says she doesn't want
any breakfast.

1462
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:07,029
Oh, why does your mother
do that to me?

1463
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:08,487
She knows it just upsets my day

1464
01:13:08,571 --> 01:13:10,196
when she doesn't come down
to breakfast.

1465
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:12,779
- A special delivery, sir.
- Thank you.

1466
01:13:14,029 --> 01:13:16,279
- Thank you.
- Where's John this morning?

1467
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:17,987
Well, John had his breakfast
early, father

1468
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,571
and went out
to see about something.

1469
01:13:19,654 --> 01:13:20,779
See about what?

1470
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,279
Well, John and I thought

1471
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:24,196
we'd work this summer
and earn some money.

1472
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:27,446
Good. Work never hurt anyone.
It's good for them.

1473
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:30,404
But if you're going to work,
work hard.

1474
01:13:30,487 --> 01:13:32,905
King Solomon had the right idea
about work.

1475
01:13:32,987 --> 01:13:36,279
"Whatever thy hand
findeth to do," Solomon said

1476
01:13:36,362 --> 01:13:38,446
"do thy doggonedest."

1477
01:13:41,863 --> 01:13:43,446
Hmm.

1478
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:45,321
Well, I don't understand this
at all.

1479
01:13:45,404 --> 01:13:47,863
Here's a letter from some woman
I never even heard of.

1480
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:51,404
- Oh, father.
- Oh, God!

1481
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:55,154
What is it, father?

1482
01:13:55,237 --> 01:13:57,654
This woman claims
that she sat on my lap

1483
01:13:57,738 --> 01:13:59,654
and that I didn't like it.

1484
01:13:59,738 --> 01:14:01,070
Huh.

1485
01:14:02,446 --> 01:14:05,154
What's that word?

1486
01:14:05,237 --> 01:14:07,487
No, that one down there.

1487
01:14:07,571 --> 01:14:10,154
It looks like curiosity.

1488
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:11,279
Oh.

1489
01:14:11,362 --> 01:14:12,321
"I only opened your letter

1490
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:14,196
as a matter of curiosity."

1491
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:16,863
- Hmph.
- Yes, go on.

1492
01:14:16,946 --> 01:14:20,070
Why, this gets worse and worse.

1493
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:24,029
It just turns into a lot
of sentimental lovey-dovey mush.

1494
01:14:24,112 --> 01:14:25,987
Chaa! Huh.

1495
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,779
If this is someone's idea
of a practical joke..

1496
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,905
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1497
01:14:32,987 --> 01:14:34,987
Nothing wrong.
Just a fool letter.

1498
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:38,613
- How are you feeling, Vinnie?
- I thought you needed me.

1499
01:14:38,696 --> 01:14:40,112
If you don't,
I'll go back to bed.

1500
01:14:40,196 --> 01:14:42,279
On, no, no, no.
Uh, come sit down

1501
01:14:42,362 --> 01:14:43,571
and, uh, get some food in you.

1502
01:14:43,654 --> 01:14:45,529
Do you good.
Build up your strength.

1503
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:47,362
Yeah, here. Sit down. Sit down.

1504
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:48,571
Here, uh..

1505
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:50,112
- What's this one's name?
- Nora.

1506
01:14:50,196 --> 01:14:52,487
Nora, uh, get Mrs. Day
some bacon and eggs.

1507
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,154
'No, Nora.'

1508
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,571
'Bring me a cup of tea
up to my room.'

1509
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:57,529
Yes, ma'am.

1510
01:14:57,613 --> 01:14:59,696
Oh, Vinnie, it's just weak

1511
01:14:59,779 --> 01:15:01,404
to give in to an ailment.

1512
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:02,863
I notice
when you have a headache

1513
01:15:02,946 --> 01:15:05,029
you yell and groan
and swear enough.

1514
01:15:05,112 --> 01:15:06,654
Well, that's to prove
to the headache

1515
01:15:06,738 --> 01:15:07,905
that I am stronger than it is.

1516
01:15:07,987 --> 01:15:11,571
I think I've caught
some kind of germ.

1517
01:15:11,654 --> 01:15:13,987
Some of my friends have had
to send for the doctor.

1518
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,446
A doctor? Oh, poppycock.

1519
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:18,863
But, Clare dear,
when people are ill

1520
01:15:18,946 --> 01:15:20,613
you have to do something.

1521
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:22,070
Certainly,
you have to do something.

1522
01:15:22,154 --> 01:15:24,905
Cheer them up.
That's the way to cure them.

1523
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:27,571
How would you go about
cheering them up?

1524
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:30,946
I? Why, I'd tell them bah!

1525
01:15:35,446 --> 01:15:37,571
Well, what have I done now?

1526
01:15:37,654 --> 01:15:39,237
Oh.

1527
01:15:39,321 --> 01:15:41,738
Oh, Clare, hush up.

1528
01:15:47,863 --> 01:15:50,987
Vinnie,
I didn't mean to upset you.

1529
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:05,362
"Dear Clarence.."

1530
01:16:21,362 --> 01:16:24,321
I, I-I was just
trying to help you.

1531
01:16:25,905 --> 01:16:27,321
You know,
w-when you take your bed

1532
01:16:27,404 --> 01:16:31,362
I have a confounded
lonely time around here.

1533
01:16:31,446 --> 01:16:32,987
So when I see you
getting it into your head

1534
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,154
that you're not feeling well

1535
01:16:34,237 --> 01:16:36,112
I want to do something about it.

1536
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:38,237
Just because some of your
friends have given into this

1537
01:16:38,321 --> 01:16:39,863
there's no reason why
you should imagine you're ill.

1538
01:16:39,946 --> 01:16:42,029
Oh, Clare, stop.

1539
01:16:42,112 --> 01:16:45,321
Get out of this house
and go to your office.

1540
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:08,487
- Did you get the job?
- Yes, for both of us.

1541
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:10,362
- Look, I've got it with me.
- What is it?

1542
01:17:10,446 --> 01:17:12,070
- Medicine.
- Medicine?

1543
01:17:12,154 --> 01:17:15,029
You took a job for us
to go out and sell medicine?

1544
01:17:15,112 --> 01:17:18,446
But it's wonderful medicine.
Look what it cures.

1545
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:21,821
"A sovereign cure
for colds, coughs, catarrh

1546
01:17:21,905 --> 01:17:24,029
"asthma, quinsy,
and sore throat

1547
01:17:24,112 --> 01:17:26,112
"poor digestion,
summer complaint, colic

1548
01:17:26,196 --> 01:17:29,321
"dyspepsia, heartburn,
and shortness of breath

1549
01:17:29,404 --> 01:17:31,362
"lumbago, rheumatism,
heart disease

1550
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:33,529
"giddiness,
and women's complaints

1551
01:17:33,613 --> 01:17:35,863
"nervous prostration,
St. Vitus' dance

1552
01:17:35,946 --> 01:17:37,863
"jaundice, la grippe,
proud flesh

1553
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:39,863
pink eye, sea sickness,
and pimples."

1554
01:17:39,946 --> 01:17:43,196
It's made from a secret formula
known only to Dr. Bartlett.

1555
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:46,196
We get 25 cents commission
on every bottle we sell.

1556
01:17:46,279 --> 01:17:49,237
And he's giving us the territory
of all Manhattan Island.

1557
01:17:49,321 --> 01:17:50,946
Well, lots of father's
and mother's friends

1558
01:17:51,029 --> 01:17:52,696
have some of those diseases.

1559
01:17:52,779 --> 01:17:54,279
Let's start out
by calling on them.

1560
01:17:54,362 --> 01:17:56,154
Yes. Oh.

1561
01:17:56,237 --> 01:17:58,905
What if they ask us
if we use it at our house?

1562
01:17:58,987 --> 01:18:02,070
Oh, yes, it would be better
if we could say we did.

1563
01:18:04,487 --> 01:18:05,654
Excuse me.

1564
01:18:05,738 --> 01:18:07,237
Oh, i-is that the tea
for Mrs. Day?

1565
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:09,070
- Yes.
- Oh, I'll take it up to her.

1566
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:12,321
Oh, thank you.
Right away now while it's hot.

1567
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:16,070
What's the matter with mother?

1568
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:19,237
I don't know.
She was just complaining.

1569
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:22,070
Say, it says here it's good
for women's complaints.

1570
01:18:24,821 --> 01:18:26,321
Here.

1571
01:18:32,487 --> 01:18:34,321
'Yes, sir, Chesapeake and Ohio,
an eighth.'

1572
01:18:34,404 --> 01:18:35,863
'New York Central,
three quarters.'

1573
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:37,112
'I'd like to see Mr. Day about'

1574
01:18:37,196 --> 01:18:38,487
'those Morris & Essex bonds.'

1575
01:18:38,571 --> 01:18:40,404
Mr. Day's very busy
this morning.

1576
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:42,362
You'll have to wait.

1577
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:49,112
- Where's father?
- Well, Master Whitney.

1578
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:50,571
Have you come
to pay us a visit?

1579
01:18:50,654 --> 01:18:51,863
Where's father?

1580
01:18:51,946 --> 01:18:54,196
He's busy in his office
with a customer.

1581
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:55,821
Master Whitney!

1582
01:18:58,196 --> 01:18:59,779
Mr. Day,
the president of the firm is--

1583
01:18:59,863 --> 01:19:02,946
Father, you have to come home
right away.

1584
01:19:03,029 --> 01:19:05,154
What's the meaning of this?
Who sent you down here?

1585
01:19:05,237 --> 01:19:07,613
- Your mother?
- No, sir. Mother's ill.

1586
01:19:07,696 --> 01:19:09,779
She's terribly ill.

1587
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:11,112
Did the doctor send you for me?

1588
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:13,321
- No, sir. It was Margaret.
- Margaret?

1589
01:19:13,404 --> 01:19:15,321
Margaret says
you're to come home right away

1590
01:19:15,404 --> 01:19:16,863
and no nonsense.

1591
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:22,154
Uh, Perkins, go down and stop
the first cab you see.

1592
01:19:22,237 --> 01:19:24,905
A cab, sir? For you, Mr. Day?

1593
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:27,237
Yes, I want a cab,
and no nonsense!

1594
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:30,654
- Yes, sir.
- Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hopkins.

1595
01:19:38,196 --> 01:19:40,404
Confound you!
Can't you go any faster?

1596
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:42,070
Alright, sir.

1597
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,154
Giddap!

1598
01:19:48,613 --> 01:19:51,112
Giddap there, you hear me!
Giddap!

1599
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:07,613
- Oh, doctor. How is Mrs. Day?
- She's a pretty sick woman.

1600
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:11,362
Well, what's wrong with her?

1601
01:20:11,446 --> 01:20:12,863
Well, do you know or don't you?

1602
01:20:12,946 --> 01:20:15,196
What did Mrs. Day have
for breakfast this morning?

1603
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:16,613
Not a thing.
I tried to get her

1604
01:20:16,696 --> 01:20:17,905
to eat something,
but she wouldn't.

1605
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:19,613
I can't understand it.

1606
01:20:19,696 --> 01:20:20,529
Understand what?

1607
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:22,029
These violent attacks of nausea.

1608
01:20:22,112 --> 01:20:24,154
It's almost as though
she were poisoned.

1609
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:26,529
- Poisoned?
- Let me take your cab.

1610
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,821
I'll try not to be gone more
than ten to fifteen minutes.

1611
01:20:28,905 --> 01:20:31,279
And, Mr. Day,
you are not to go into her room.

1612
01:20:32,696 --> 01:20:33,987
You'd better get her well.

1613
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,863
Right away
or you'll hear from me.

1614
01:20:35,946 --> 01:20:38,571
- Turn west on 27th Street.
- Giddap. Giddap.

1615
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:50,154
- How is mother?
- I don't know.

1616
01:20:50,237 --> 01:20:51,738
Well, she better be
good and sick

1617
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:54,321
or father may be mad at me
for getting him up here.

1618
01:20:54,404 --> 01:20:56,321
Specially in a cab.

1619
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,321
- Has your father come?
- Yes, just now.

1620
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:02,987
Where are you going, Margaret?

1621
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:05,237
I have to go for the minister.

1622
01:21:11,654 --> 01:21:14,571
I guess the minister's
coming to baptize father

1623
01:21:14,654 --> 01:21:16,237
so he won't have to go to hell.

1624
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:18,321
You can't be baptized
in a house.

1625
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:21,863
- You've got to have water.
- We have lots of water.

1626
01:21:21,946 --> 01:21:23,863
Not the right kind.

1627
01:21:29,154 --> 01:21:31,112
Is mother better, father?

1628
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:34,237
How can I tell? She wouldn't
let me in the room with her.

1629
01:21:34,321 --> 01:21:35,779
These confounded doctors
never know

1630
01:21:35,863 --> 01:21:38,029
what's the matter with anybody.

1631
01:21:44,863 --> 01:21:46,654
Father?

1632
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:47,946
Yes?

1633
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:50,821
Mother's going to get well,
isn't she?

1634
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:53,154
Of course,
she's going to get well.

1635
01:21:54,613 --> 01:21:56,362
Father, may we come in?

1636
01:21:56,446 --> 01:21:59,571
It's lonesome without mother.

1637
01:21:59,654 --> 01:22:02,863
Yes, it is, Harlan.
It's lonesome.

1638
01:22:02,946 --> 01:22:04,613
Come in, boys.

1639
01:22:08,613 --> 01:22:10,446
What have you been doing,
Harlan?

1640
01:22:10,529 --> 01:22:13,404
Nothing.
They won't let me upstairs.

1641
01:22:14,821 --> 01:22:15,863
What about you, Whitney?

1642
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:16,987
I was supposed to learn

1643
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,070
the rest of my catechism.

1644
01:22:19,154 --> 01:22:21,237
Will you hear me, father?

1645
01:22:23,237 --> 01:22:25,404
Yes, Whitney, I'll hear you.

1646
01:22:27,362 --> 01:22:28,863
Start here.

1647
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,070
"How many parts are there
in a sacrament?"

1648
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:35,863
Two, the outward visible sign

1649
01:22:35,946 --> 01:22:38,654
and the inward spiritual grace.

1650
01:22:38,738 --> 01:22:41,154
"What is the outward
visible sign or form

1651
01:22:41,237 --> 01:22:43,487
in bap, baptism?"

1652
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:47,863
Water, wherein the person
is baptized in the name of..

1653
01:22:47,946 --> 01:22:51,404
You haven't been baptized,
have you, father?

1654
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:54,196
Whitney, what is the outward
visible sign?

1655
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:57,779
Water, wherein the person..

1656
01:22:57,863 --> 01:22:59,821
'...wherein the person..'

1657
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:01,029
You don't know it well enough,
Whitney.

1658
01:23:01,112 --> 01:23:03,779
You'd better go and study it
some more.

1659
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:05,196
Do you want me to read to you,
Harlan?

1660
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:08,696
Father, are they gonna
put you into hell?

1661
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:11,237
Whitney, take Harlan with you.

1662
01:25:06,779 --> 01:25:10,487
Oh, what's the world coming to?

1663
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:13,487
Everybody's sending for doctors.

1664
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:15,571
Doctors don't do you any good.

1665
01:25:15,654 --> 01:25:17,487
Only make you feel worse.

1666
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:18,779
All poppycock.

1667
01:25:23,404 --> 01:25:25,905
Who's ringing that bell?

1668
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:27,863
Stop that noise!

1669
01:25:27,946 --> 01:25:29,821
Stop it, I say!

1670
01:25:29,905 --> 01:25:31,946
What idiot's ringing that bell?

1671
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:36,863
Mr. Day, we must all be quiet.

1672
01:25:36,946 --> 01:25:38,905
- Mrs. Day's very ill.
- I know she's ill.

1673
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:40,738
Go up and see
if she needs anything.

1674
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:42,529
And what are you doing
out of the house?

1675
01:25:42,613 --> 01:25:44,196
I sent for the minister.

1676
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:45,779
- The minister?
- He'll be right in.

1677
01:25:45,863 --> 01:25:48,070
He's paying off the cab.

1678
01:25:54,946 --> 01:25:56,905
I was deeply shocked to learn
the serious nature

1679
01:25:56,987 --> 01:26:00,029
of Mrs. Day's illness.
Will you take me up to her?

1680
01:26:00,112 --> 01:26:02,404
She's resting now.
She can't be disturbed.

1681
01:26:02,487 --> 01:26:03,821
The doctor will be back
in a minute.

1682
01:26:03,905 --> 01:26:05,987
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Mrs. Day has been

1683
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:07,821
a tower of strength
in the parish.

1684
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:10,571
Everyone liked her so much.

1685
01:26:10,654 --> 01:26:13,070
Yes, she was a fine woman.

1686
01:26:13,154 --> 01:26:15,070
I wish to heaven
you wouldn't talk about Mrs. Day

1687
01:26:15,154 --> 01:26:17,362
as if she were dead.

1688
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:23,821
- Is the doctor back yet?
- No, does she need him?

1689
01:26:23,905 --> 01:26:25,196
Well, she's kind of restless.

1690
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:27,905
She's talking in her sleep
and twisting and turning.

1691
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:41,321
Well, doctor, it seems to me

1692
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:42,821
that was a pretty long
ten minutes.

1693
01:26:42,905 --> 01:26:45,404
See here, Mr. Day.
if I'm to handle this case--

1694
01:26:45,487 --> 01:26:47,696
How can you handle it
if you're out of the house?

1695
01:26:47,779 --> 01:26:48,905
Who is this?

1696
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:50,863
- It's Dr. Somers.
- How do you do?

1697
01:26:50,946 --> 01:26:52,404
I felt that Mrs. Day's condition

1698
01:26:52,487 --> 01:26:53,821
warranted my getting
Dr. Somers here

1699
01:26:53,905 --> 01:26:55,946
as soon as possible
for consultation.

1700
01:26:56,029 --> 01:26:58,446
I hope that meets
with your approval?

1701
01:26:59,738 --> 01:27:02,237
Why, yes, of course.

1702
01:27:02,321 --> 01:27:05,946
- Anything that can be done.
- Upstairs, doctor.

1703
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:07,696
Pardon me.

1704
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:14,987
Mrs. Day is in good hands now,
Mr. Day.

1705
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:17,779
There's nothing you and I
can do at the moment to help.

1706
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:23,613
- Dr. Lloyd?
- Yes?

1707
01:27:23,696 --> 01:27:25,987
There's something that's
troubling Mrs. Day's mind.

1708
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:27,404
Oh?

1709
01:27:27,487 --> 01:27:29,487
I think you know
what I refer to.

1710
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:33,946
Yes. You mean the fact that
you've never been baptized.

1711
01:27:34,029 --> 01:27:35,987
Yes, I gathered
that you knew about it

1712
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:37,987
from your sermon last Sunday.

1713
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:40,905
But let's not get angry.

1714
01:27:40,987 --> 01:27:44,279
I think something
had better be done about it.

1715
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:46,154
Yes, Mr. Day?

1716
01:27:46,237 --> 01:27:47,821
When the doctors get through
up there

1717
01:27:47,905 --> 01:27:49,362
I want you to talk to Mrs. Day.

1718
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:50,404
I want you to tell her
something.

1719
01:27:50,487 --> 01:27:51,613
Well, I'd be glad to.

1720
01:27:51,696 --> 01:27:53,279
You're just the man to do it.

1721
01:27:53,362 --> 01:27:55,529
She shouldn't be upset
about this.

1722
01:27:55,613 --> 01:27:57,738
I want you to tell her
that my being baptized

1723
01:27:57,821 --> 01:28:00,905
would just be a lot
of confounded nonsense.

1724
01:28:00,987 --> 01:28:02,154
But, Mr. Day--

1725
01:28:02,237 --> 01:28:04,863
Oh, she'll take your word
on a thing like that.

1726
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:08,070
And we both must do everything
we can to help her now.

1727
01:28:08,154 --> 01:28:10,070
But the solution is so simple.

1728
01:28:10,154 --> 01:28:14,321
It would take only your consent
to be baptized.

1729
01:28:14,404 --> 01:28:16,112
That's out of the question.

1730
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:18,571
And I'm surprised
that a grown man like you

1731
01:28:18,654 --> 01:28:20,863
would suggest such a thing.

1732
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:32,571
Well, doctor, how is she?
What have you decided?

1733
01:28:32,654 --> 01:28:36,029
Is there a room we could use
for our consultation?

1734
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:39,154
- Oh, yes, my library.
- Doctor.

1735
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:41,613
Dr. Somers,
this isn't serious, is it?

1736
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:43,529
Uh, after we've had
our consultation

1737
01:28:43,613 --> 01:28:45,029
we'll talk to you, Mr. Day.

1738
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:45,987
But surely--

1739
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:48,237
Rest assured, Dr. Somers will do

1740
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:50,196
everything
that is humanly possible.

1741
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:53,029
Uh, we'll try not to be long.

1742
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:15,112
Tell me, this Dr., uh, Somers

1743
01:29:15,196 --> 01:29:16,613
he's very highly thought of,
isn't he?

1744
01:29:16,696 --> 01:29:17,905
Oh, yes.

1745
01:29:17,987 --> 01:29:20,237
If Vinnie is seriously..

1746
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:22,696
If anyone could help her,
he could.

1747
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:25,321
- Don't you think?
- Very fine physician.

1748
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:29,029
But there is a greater help

1749
01:29:29,112 --> 01:29:31,529
ever-present
in the hour of need.

1750
01:29:31,613 --> 01:29:34,654
Let us turn to him in prayer.

1751
01:29:36,946 --> 01:29:39,154
Let us kneel and pray.

1752
01:29:44,738 --> 01:29:47,070
Let us kneel and pray.

1753
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:58,696
Oh, Lord,
look down from heaven.

1754
01:29:58,779 --> 01:30:02,779
Behold, visit, and relieve
this Thy servant

1755
01:30:02,863 --> 01:30:05,237
who is grieved with sickness.

1756
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:07,738
Have mercy on her, oh, Lord.

1757
01:30:07,821 --> 01:30:10,446
Have mercy
on this miserable sinner.

1758
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:12,779
Forgive her
and extend Thy accustomed--

1759
01:30:12,863 --> 01:30:15,279
She's not a miserable sinner,
and you know it!

1760
01:30:15,362 --> 01:30:18,696
Oh, God! You know Vinnie
is not a miserable sinner!

1761
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:20,112
She's a fine woman!

1762
01:30:20,196 --> 01:30:21,654
'She shouldn't be
made to suffer!'

1763
01:30:21,738 --> 01:30:24,112
It's got to stop, I tell you!
It's got to stop!

1764
01:30:24,196 --> 01:30:25,529
Have mercy, I say!

1765
01:30:25,613 --> 01:30:27,112
Have mercy, I tell you!

1766
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:29,654
What's the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

1767
01:30:29,738 --> 01:30:32,321
Vinnie. Vinnie, what are you
doing down here?

1768
01:30:32,404 --> 01:30:35,446
You shouldn't be out of bed.
You get right back upstairs.

1769
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:38,487
I heard you call.
Do you need me?

1770
01:30:38,571 --> 01:30:40,863
Vinnie, I know now
how much I need you.

1771
01:30:40,946 --> 01:30:42,738
Get well, Vinnie.
I'll be baptized.

1772
01:30:42,821 --> 01:30:45,821
- I promise I'll be baptized.
- You will?

1773
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:48,362
- I'll do anything.
- Oh, Clare.

1774
01:30:48,446 --> 01:30:50,321
We'll go to Europe,
just we two.

1775
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:51,905
You won't have to worry
about the children

1776
01:30:51,987 --> 01:30:54,446
or the household accounts or..

1777
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:56,905
Vinnie.

1778
01:30:59,779 --> 01:31:01,987
Don't worry, Mr. Day.
She'll be alright now.

1779
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:03,487
Bless you
for what you have done.

1780
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:06,321
- What did I do?
- You promised to be baptized.

1781
01:31:06,404 --> 01:31:08,905
I did? Oh, God!

1782
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:50,946
- Isn't it drafty here, mother?
- Shall I get your coat, mother?

1783
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:52,571
- The draft--
- No, thank you.

1784
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:54,112
I'm quite comfortable,
thank you.

1785
01:31:54,196 --> 01:31:55,529
Come on now.
Let's stay together.

1786
01:31:55,613 --> 01:31:57,279
Harlan,
don't you get lost again.

1787
01:31:57,362 --> 01:32:00,738
Aren't the hats lovely
this year?

1788
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:02,487
Ostrich feathers.

1789
01:32:02,571 --> 01:32:05,279
You wouldn't wear that hat,
would you, mother?

1790
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:07,196
Oh, I think that's very pretty.

1791
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:09,446
I think they're all pretty.

1792
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:12,154
Oh, I do need
some pink silk thread.

1793
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:18,571
Oh, isn't this applique
beautiful?

1794
01:32:18,654 --> 01:32:20,446
Just arrived from Paris, madam.

1795
01:32:20,529 --> 01:32:21,946
It's charming.

1796
01:32:22,029 --> 01:32:23,946
What are you looking for,
mother?

1797
01:32:24,029 --> 01:32:25,946
Oh, I'm just shopping.

1798
01:32:28,196 --> 01:32:29,946
I think
I'll just take a plain one.

1799
01:32:30,029 --> 01:32:31,112
But this is the very latest.

1800
01:32:31,196 --> 01:32:33,070
We've only had them in
a few days.

1801
01:32:33,154 --> 01:32:34,987
Remember, mother,
this is your first day out.

1802
01:32:35,070 --> 01:32:36,404
You mustn't get too tired.

1803
01:32:36,487 --> 01:32:38,070
No, I'm saving myself, dear.

1804
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:40,362
I have to.
Cousin Cora's coming tomorrow.

1805
01:32:40,446 --> 01:32:42,154
She is?
Does father know about it?

1806
01:32:42,237 --> 01:32:44,112
- Not yet.
- Is Mary coming too?

1807
01:32:44,196 --> 01:32:46,404
Yes, dear.
Harlan, don't touch things.

1808
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:48,987
- I'll bet you knew it.
- No, honest, I didn't.

1809
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,613
- Not tomorrow.
- Yes, it is.

1810
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:57,613
'Do we have any more
of this material?'

1811
01:32:57,696 --> 01:32:59,613
- 'Yes, we do.'
- 'Thank you.'

1812
01:33:02,362 --> 01:33:05,654
'This one
is genuine imitation Dresden.'

1813
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:09,154
'The original design by Duriet.'

1814
01:33:09,237 --> 01:33:11,571
John, isn't this
the darlingest thing?

1815
01:33:11,654 --> 01:33:13,154
It's exactly
what I've always wanted.

1816
01:33:13,237 --> 01:33:14,529
How much is this lovely pug dog?

1817
01:33:14,613 --> 01:33:15,821
Uh, $15, ma'am.

1818
01:33:15,905 --> 01:33:18,196
- Fifteen dollars.
- Gee whiz, mother.

1819
01:33:18,279 --> 01:33:20,946
We can buy
a real live bloodhound for $5.

1820
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:24,863
Oh, isn't he perfectly adorable?

1821
01:33:24,946 --> 01:33:26,571
Oh, I shouldn't.

1822
01:33:26,654 --> 01:33:30,112
- I know I shouldn't.
- 'Mrs. Day.'

1823
01:33:30,196 --> 01:33:32,529
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.

1824
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:34,987
How nice to see you.
Are you quite recovered?

1825
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:37,112
Almost.
This is my first day out.

1826
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:39,196
We've missed you at the church.
You remember Mr. Morley.

1827
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:40,696
- How do you do, Mrs. Day?
- How do you do?

1828
01:33:40,779 --> 01:33:41,987
Mr. Morley preached the Sunday

1829
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:43,571
Dr. Lloyd was ill.

1830
01:33:43,654 --> 01:33:45,029
Oh, yes.

1831
01:33:45,112 --> 01:33:47,779
I can't tell you
how much I enjoyed your sermon.

1832
01:33:47,863 --> 01:33:49,654
Even my husband
enjoyed your sermon.

1833
01:33:49,738 --> 01:33:52,237
We've just come from the board
meeting of the foreign missions.

1834
01:33:52,321 --> 01:33:53,779
I'm taking Mr. Morley home
to lunch.

1835
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:56,196
I had to drop in here
to pick up a purchase.

1836
01:33:56,279 --> 01:33:58,029
I won't be a minute.

1837
01:33:58,112 --> 01:34:00,905
- Is your parish in the city?
- Yes, it's on the outskirts.

1838
01:34:00,987 --> 01:34:02,571
My church is in Audubon Park.

1839
01:34:02,654 --> 01:34:04,154
Oh, way up there.

1840
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:06,279
Oh, are you acquainted
in Audubon Park?

1841
01:34:06,362 --> 01:34:08,987
No, I don't believe
we know a soul there.

1842
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:17,404
Mr. Morley,
would this be possible?

1843
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:19,196
Uh, my husband, Mr. Day..

1844
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:21,821
If we lower the collar,
it will be a very fine fit.

1845
01:34:21,905 --> 01:34:24,404
You wouldn't find a better suit
of clothes in the city for $15.

1846
01:34:24,487 --> 01:34:27,863
Oh, it's not the price.
It's the money.

1847
01:34:27,946 --> 01:34:29,446
Thank you for holding it for me.

1848
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:30,905
You're welcome.

1849
01:34:32,196 --> 01:34:34,738
Goodbye, Mrs. Day.
I hope we meet again soon.

1850
01:34:34,821 --> 01:34:37,029
Goodbye. It was very pleasant
meeting you again.

1851
01:34:37,112 --> 01:34:38,905
I think
it was divine providence.

1852
01:34:38,987 --> 01:34:41,070
I shall be delighted
to be of service.

1853
01:34:41,154 --> 01:34:44,070
- Goodbye, Mr. Morley. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1854
01:34:44,154 --> 01:34:45,404
- May I work it?
- Oh, no.

1855
01:34:45,487 --> 01:34:46,654
It's against the rules.

1856
01:35:05,946 --> 01:35:08,279
Hello.

1857
01:35:08,362 --> 01:35:11,070
Oh, what did you bring home
more medicine for?

1858
01:35:11,154 --> 01:35:12,571
Dr. Bartlett paid us off,
didn't he?

1859
01:35:12,654 --> 01:35:15,738
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, Jiminy, you scared me.

1860
01:35:15,821 --> 01:35:17,779
I've got to take $15
right down to McCreery's.

1861
01:35:17,863 --> 01:35:19,154
I bought a suit there
this morning and I said

1862
01:35:19,237 --> 01:35:20,779
I'd have the money
this afternoon.

1863
01:35:20,863 --> 01:35:23,487
- Gee, that's too bad.
- What's too bad?

1864
01:35:23,571 --> 01:35:26,613
- Well, well, you see, Clarence.
- What?

1865
01:35:26,696 --> 01:35:28,654
Dr. Bartlett
paid us off in medicine.

1866
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:29,946
Oh, God!

1867
01:35:30,029 --> 01:35:31,196
Well, he thanked us, too

1868
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:32,529
for our services to mankind.

1869
01:35:32,613 --> 01:35:34,279
But my suit,
I've got to have it tomorrow.

1870
01:35:34,362 --> 01:35:36,112
And besides,
they're making the alterations.

1871
01:35:36,196 --> 01:35:37,654
I've gotta have $15.

1872
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:40,029
Maybe you could offer them
15 bottles of medicine.

1873
01:35:40,112 --> 01:35:42,946
Oh, they wouldn't take it.
McCreery's don't sell medicine.

1874
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,946
Father!

1875
01:35:46,987 --> 01:35:49,196
Vinnie, I'm home!

1876
01:35:50,779 --> 01:35:52,779
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How's your mother, Clarence?

1877
01:35:52,863 --> 01:35:54,446
Oh, the ride this morning
did her a lot of good.

1878
01:35:54,529 --> 01:35:56,487
She'll be well enough to go
to church with us next Sunday.

1879
01:35:56,571 --> 01:35:57,613
Ah, fine.

1880
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,362
Uh, father, have you noticed

1881
01:35:59,446 --> 01:36:01,779
I haven't been kneeling down
in church lately?

1882
01:36:01,863 --> 01:36:03,237
Don't let your mother
catch you at it.

1883
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:05,154
Then I have to have a new suit
of clothes right away.

1884
01:36:05,237 --> 01:36:06,362
That doesn't make sense.

1885
01:36:06,446 --> 01:36:07,821
I can't do anything
in your clothes

1886
01:36:07,905 --> 01:36:08,821
that you wouldn't do.

1887
01:36:08,905 --> 01:36:10,404
Well, if my old clothes make you

1888
01:36:10,487 --> 01:36:12,487
behave yourself, I don't think
you ought to wear anything else.

1889
01:36:12,571 --> 01:36:14,821
Oh, no, you're you and I'm me.
I wanna be myself.

1890
01:36:14,905 --> 01:36:17,821
I mean, suppose I should wanna
kneel down in front of a girl.

1891
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,154
Why in heaven's name should you
want to do a thing like that?

1892
01:36:20,237 --> 01:36:22,196
Well, I've got to propose
to a girl sometime.

1893
01:36:22,279 --> 01:36:23,821
- Clarence.
- Oh, not right away.

1894
01:36:23,905 --> 01:36:26,654
But for $15, I can get
a good suit of clothes.

1895
01:36:26,738 --> 01:36:28,821
Clarence, you're beginning
to talk as crazy as your..

1896
01:36:28,905 --> 01:36:32,821
Hello, Vinnie. You're feeling
better today, huh?

1897
01:36:32,905 --> 01:36:34,696
Much better.
Thank you, Clare.

1898
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:36,571
You don't have to hurry home
from the office

1899
01:36:36,654 --> 01:36:37,821
every day like this.

1900
01:36:37,905 --> 01:36:39,863
Uh, with business
the way it is, there's no use

1901
01:36:39,946 --> 01:36:41,404
going to the office at all.

1902
01:36:41,487 --> 01:36:44,112
Yes, you do look better, Vinnie.
What did you do today?

1903
01:36:44,196 --> 01:36:47,112
Well, I got a carriage
and took the boys for a ride.

1904
01:36:47,196 --> 01:36:49,863
And we stopped in
at McCreery's, and..

1905
01:36:49,946 --> 01:36:54,029
Oh, Clare, I have the most
wonderful news for you.

1906
01:36:54,112 --> 01:36:56,112
Who do you think I met?

1907
01:36:56,196 --> 01:36:57,613
Mr. Morley.

1908
01:36:57,696 --> 01:36:59,821
Morley? Never heard of him?

1909
01:36:59,905 --> 01:37:01,529
Remember
that nice young minister

1910
01:37:01,613 --> 01:37:04,070
who substituted for Dr. Lloyd
one Sunday.

1911
01:37:04,154 --> 01:37:06,446
Oh, yes.
Bright, young fellow.

1912
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:09,613
Preached a good sensible sermon.
Short one too.

1913
01:37:09,696 --> 01:37:11,029
Ought to be more ministers
like him.

1914
01:37:11,112 --> 01:37:13,946
Well, Clare, his parish
is in Audubon Park.

1915
01:37:14,029 --> 01:37:15,696
You know, way up above Harlem.

1916
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:19,279
Nobody knows you up there.
You'll be perfectly safe.

1917
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:22,070
Safe? Vinnie, what the devil
are you talking about?

1918
01:37:22,154 --> 01:37:24,237
I've gone all over everything
with Mr. Morley

1919
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:26,738
and he's agreed
to baptize you.

1920
01:37:26,821 --> 01:37:28,404
Oh, he has.

1921
01:37:28,487 --> 01:37:31,696
The young whippersnapper.
Very nice of him.

1922
01:37:31,779 --> 01:37:32,946
We can go up there any morning.

1923
01:37:33,029 --> 01:37:34,905
We don't even have to make
an appointment.

1924
01:37:34,987 --> 01:37:37,863
Who said I was going
to be baptized at all?

1925
01:37:37,946 --> 01:37:40,571
Why, Clare, you did.

1926
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:41,946
Now, Vinnie.

1927
01:37:42,029 --> 01:37:44,987
You gave me your promise,
your sacred promise.

1928
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:47,905
You said, "I'll be baptized.
I promise I'll be baptized."

1929
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,529
Well, what if I did?

1930
01:37:49,613 --> 01:37:53,446
Clare, aren't you a man
of your word?

1931
01:37:54,987 --> 01:37:57,196
Vinnie, we all thought
you were dying.

1932
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:59,779
So naturally,
I said that to cheer you up.

1933
01:37:59,863 --> 01:38:03,070
As a matter of fact, the doctor
told me that's what cured you.

1934
01:38:03,154 --> 01:38:04,821
So it seems to me
pretty ungrateful of you

1935
01:38:04,905 --> 01:38:06,779
to press this matter
any further.

1936
01:38:06,863 --> 01:38:09,279
My being well
has nothing to do with it.

1937
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:12,487
You gave me your word.
You gave the Lord your word.

1938
01:38:12,571 --> 01:38:14,613
And you're going to march
yourself up to Mr. Morley's

1939
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:16,446
church some morning
before you go to the office

1940
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:18,779
and be christened.
If you think for one minute--

1941
01:38:18,863 --> 01:38:20,196
What in the name of heaven
is that?

1942
01:38:20,279 --> 01:38:22,196
If you think I'm going
to let you add the sin

1943
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:24,362
of breaking your solemn
and sacred promise--

1944
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:27,279
I demand to know
what that repulsive object is?

1945
01:38:27,362 --> 01:38:30,279
It's perfectly plain what it is.
It's a pug dog.

1946
01:38:30,362 --> 01:38:31,696
What is it doing in this house?

1947
01:38:31,779 --> 01:38:33,946
I wanted it and I bought it.

1948
01:38:34,029 --> 01:38:35,779
You spent good money for that?

1949
01:38:35,863 --> 01:38:38,571
Clare, don't try
to change the subject.

1950
01:38:38,654 --> 01:38:40,613
How much did you pay
for that atrocity?

1951
01:38:40,696 --> 01:38:43,696
I didn't pay anything for it.
I charged it.

1952
01:38:43,779 --> 01:38:44,987
Charged it?
I might have known.

1953
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:47,279
- How much was it?
- Fifteen dollars.

1954
01:38:47,362 --> 01:38:50,237
- $15 for that eyesore?
- Uh, Clare..

1955
01:38:50,321 --> 01:38:53,821
Don't you call this lovely
work of art an eyesore.

1956
01:38:53,905 --> 01:38:55,738
It will look beautiful
sitting on a red cushion

1957
01:38:55,821 --> 01:38:57,863
by the fireplace
in the living room.

1958
01:38:57,946 --> 01:39:00,154
If that sits in the living room,
I won't.

1959
01:39:00,237 --> 01:39:03,070
Furthermore, I don't even want
it in the same house with me.

1960
01:39:03,154 --> 01:39:04,154
Get it out of here!

1961
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:06,196
Clare..

1962
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,654
...you're not going
to get out of this room

1963
01:39:08,738 --> 01:39:10,446
until you set a date
for your baptism.

1964
01:39:10,529 --> 01:39:13,029
I'll tell you one thing.
I'll never be baptized

1965
01:39:13,112 --> 01:39:16,237
as long as that hideous
monstrosity is in this house.

1966
01:39:19,237 --> 01:39:20,946
Alright.

1967
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:23,154
Alright!

1968
01:39:23,237 --> 01:39:24,571
Clarence.

1969
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:29,529
That pug dog
goes back this afternoon

1970
01:39:29,613 --> 01:39:31,654
and he's christened
first thing in the morning.

1971
01:39:31,738 --> 01:39:33,112
You heard him,
didn't you, Clarence?

1972
01:39:33,196 --> 01:39:34,821
You heard him say
that he'd be baptized

1973
01:39:34,905 --> 01:39:37,237
as soon as I got this pug dog
out of the house.

1974
01:39:37,321 --> 01:39:39,362
You hurry right back
to McCreery's with it

1975
01:39:39,446 --> 01:39:42,029
and be sure
they credit us with $15.

1976
01:39:42,112 --> 01:39:43,821
Oh, mother,
while we were at McCreery's

1977
01:39:43,905 --> 01:39:45,696
I happened to see a suit
I'd like very much

1978
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:47,237
and the suit was only $15.

1979
01:39:47,321 --> 01:39:49,571
Well, Clarence, I'm afraid
your suit will have to wait

1980
01:39:49,654 --> 01:39:51,279
until after
I get your father christened.

1981
01:39:51,362 --> 01:39:53,070
Well, no, I meant
that since the suit cost

1982
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:54,362
just the same as the pug dog

1983
01:39:54,446 --> 01:39:57,571
If I exchanged the pug dog
for the suit..

1984
01:39:57,654 --> 01:39:59,196
Why, yes.

1985
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:02,279
Then the suit wouldn't cost
your father anything.

1986
01:40:02,362 --> 01:40:05,321
Why, how bright of you,
Clarence, to think of that.

1987
01:40:05,404 --> 01:40:07,738
I'd better start right away
before McCreery's closes.

1988
01:40:07,821 --> 01:40:09,738
Yes. Now let's see.

1989
01:40:09,821 --> 01:40:11,237
If we're going
to take your father

1990
01:40:11,321 --> 01:40:13,571
all the way to Audubon Park..

1991
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:16,279
Clarence, on your way back,
you stop at the livery stable

1992
01:40:16,362 --> 01:40:18,905
and tell them to have a cab here
at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning.

1993
01:40:18,987 --> 01:40:20,696
Mother, a cab?
Do you think you ought to?

1994
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:22,404
We can't walk
all the way to Audubon Park.

1995
01:40:22,487 --> 01:40:23,946
But you know what
a cab does to father.

1996
01:40:24,029 --> 01:40:25,779
This is
a very important occasion.

1997
01:40:25,863 --> 01:40:28,070
- Alright.
- Get one of their best cabs.

1998
01:40:28,154 --> 01:40:29,571
The kind they use at funerals.

1999
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:32,404
Those cost $2 an hour.
And if father gets mad--

2000
01:40:32,487 --> 01:40:33,987
Well, if your father
starts to argue

2001
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:35,196
in the morning, you remember--

2002
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,362
Oh, he agreed to it.
We both heard him.

2003
01:40:42,821 --> 01:40:46,112
I hope you notice Clarence
is returning the pug dog.

2004
01:40:46,196 --> 01:40:49,362
'Well, that's a sign you're
getting your faculties back.'

2005
01:40:49,446 --> 01:40:51,613
Don't dawdle, Clarence.

2006
01:41:10,029 --> 01:41:12,613
Vinnie, it's good
to hear you singing again.

2007
01:41:25,487 --> 01:41:27,779
Oh, uh, on the way uptown

2008
01:41:27,863 --> 01:41:29,362
I stopped in at Tiffany's

2009
01:41:29,446 --> 01:41:32,070
and, uh, bought you
a little something.

2010
01:41:32,154 --> 01:41:34,112
Thought you might like it.

2011
01:41:34,196 --> 01:41:36,821
Clare!

2012
01:41:36,905 --> 01:41:39,654
What a beautiful ring.

2013
01:41:39,738 --> 01:41:42,154
Well, I'm glad
if it pleases you.

2014
01:41:42,237 --> 01:41:45,987
Oh, Clare, how sweet of you.

2015
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,529
I don't know how to thank you.

2016
01:41:48,613 --> 01:41:49,821
- Mmm.
- Ah.

2017
01:41:49,905 --> 01:41:51,112
Well, it's thanks enough for me

2018
01:41:51,196 --> 01:41:52,905
just to have you
up and around again.

2019
01:41:52,987 --> 01:41:54,154
You know,
when you're ill, Vinnie

2020
01:41:54,237 --> 01:41:56,237
this house is like a tomb.

2021
01:41:56,321 --> 01:41:57,362
There's no excitement.

2022
01:41:57,446 --> 01:41:59,237
That's the loveliest ring

2023
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,821
you ever bought me.

2024
01:42:00,905 --> 01:42:03,029
Now that I have this,
you needn't buy me

2025
01:42:03,112 --> 01:42:04,946
any more rings.

2026
01:42:05,029 --> 01:42:06,529
Well,
if you don't want any more.

2027
01:42:06,613 --> 01:42:09,446
What I'd really like now
is a nice diamond necklace.

2028
01:42:11,446 --> 01:42:15,404
Vinnie, do you know how much
a diamond necklace costs?

2029
01:42:15,487 --> 01:42:16,987
Yes, I know, Clare.
But don't you see?

2030
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:18,196
Your giving me this shows

2031
01:42:18,279 --> 01:42:19,863
I mean
a little something to you.

2032
01:42:19,946 --> 01:42:22,196
- Now a diamond necklace--
- Good heaven.

2033
01:42:22,279 --> 01:42:24,946
If you don't know by this time
how I feel about you.

2034
01:42:25,029 --> 01:42:26,946
We've been married for 20 years

2035
01:42:27,029 --> 01:42:29,196
and I've loved you
every minute of it.

2036
01:42:30,946 --> 01:42:32,863
What did you say, Clare?

2037
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:34,321
I said we've been married
for 20 years

2038
01:42:34,404 --> 01:42:36,196
and I've loved you
every minute of it.

2039
01:42:36,279 --> 01:42:38,654
But if I have to buy out
jewelry stores to prove it..

2040
01:42:38,738 --> 01:42:41,237
If I haven't shown it to you
in my words and actions

2041
01:42:41,321 --> 01:42:43,279
well, I might as well..

2042
01:42:44,738 --> 01:42:47,738
Well, what have I done now?

2043
01:42:47,821 --> 01:42:49,863
It's alright, Clare.

2044
01:42:49,946 --> 01:42:52,279
I'm just so happy.

2045
01:42:53,446 --> 01:42:54,696
Happy?

2046
01:42:56,487 --> 01:42:58,571
You said you loved me.

2047
01:42:58,654 --> 01:43:00,070
And this beautiful ring

2048
01:43:00,154 --> 01:43:02,821
that's something else
I didn't expect.

2049
01:43:02,905 --> 01:43:06,321
Oh, Clare, I love surprises.

2050
01:43:08,738 --> 01:43:11,779
That's another thing I've never
understood about you, Vinnie.

2051
01:43:11,863 --> 01:43:13,529
Now I like to know
what to expect.

2052
01:43:13,613 --> 01:43:16,029
- Then I'm prepared to meet it.
- Yes, I know, Clare.

2053
01:43:16,112 --> 01:43:17,529
But life would be pretty dull

2054
01:43:17,613 --> 01:43:19,446
if we always knew
what was coming.

2055
01:43:19,529 --> 01:43:21,696
Well, it's certainly not dull
around here.

2056
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,654
In this house, you never know

2057
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:25,404
what's going to hit you
tomorrow.

2058
01:44:34,905 --> 01:44:37,321
Well, then, Harlan, the very..

2059
01:44:38,696 --> 01:44:40,446
Who are you?
What's your name?

2060
01:44:40,529 --> 01:44:42,738
- Margaret, sir.
- Can't be Margaret.

2061
01:44:42,821 --> 01:44:44,571
We've got one Margaret
in the house.

2062
01:44:44,654 --> 01:44:47,446
At home,
they call me Maggie, sir.

2063
01:44:47,529 --> 01:44:48,987
Alright, Maggie.

2064
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,905
If her name's Margaret,
that's a good sign.

2065
01:44:51,987 --> 01:44:53,321
Maybe she'll stay a while.

2066
01:44:54,905 --> 01:44:56,613
Do you know, boys,
your mother used to be

2067
01:44:56,696 --> 01:44:59,404
just the same about cooks
as she is about maids?

2068
01:44:59,487 --> 01:45:01,487
Never could keep them
for some reason.

2069
01:45:01,571 --> 01:45:06,029
Well, one day about, uh,
14 years ago..

2070
01:45:06,112 --> 01:45:08,905
Yes, it was right after
you were born, John.

2071
01:45:08,987 --> 01:45:10,946
My, you were a homely baby.

2072
01:45:18,279 --> 01:45:19,821
Thank you, Margaret.

2073
01:45:22,112 --> 01:45:24,738
- Good morning, boys.
- Good morning, mother.

2074
01:45:24,821 --> 01:45:27,029
- Good morning, Clare.
- Morning, Vinnie.

2075
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,863
Why, you look as though
you were dressed for a wedding.

2076
01:45:29,946 --> 01:45:31,779
- Do I, dear?
- 'Yes.'

2077
01:45:31,863 --> 01:45:34,696
- Have a good night?
- Yes, thank you, Clare.

2078
01:45:34,779 --> 01:45:37,112
Ah, sit down, Vinnie.

2079
01:45:37,196 --> 01:45:38,654
Sit down, boys.

2080
01:45:40,279 --> 01:45:42,029
Oh, thank you, Clarence.

2081
01:45:42,112 --> 01:45:46,070
Well, seems to me everyone's
all dressed up this morning.

2082
01:45:46,154 --> 01:45:48,987
What's on the program
for this fine day?

2083
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:51,613
Well, uh, this afternoon
May Lewis' mother

2084
01:45:51,696 --> 01:45:54,112
is giving a party for everyone
in May's dancing class.

2085
01:45:54,196 --> 01:45:57,279
- Harlan's going to that.
- I don't want to go, mama.

2086
01:45:57,362 --> 01:45:59,487
Harlan, don't you
wanna go to a party

2087
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:00,946
and get ice cream and cake?

2088
01:46:01,029 --> 01:46:04,154
May Lewis
always tries to kiss me!

2089
01:46:04,237 --> 01:46:06,070
Hmm.

2090
01:46:06,154 --> 01:46:07,863
When you get a little older,
you won't object

2091
01:46:07,946 --> 01:46:09,738
to girls wanting to kiss you.

2092
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:11,821
Will he, Clarence?

2093
01:46:16,487 --> 01:46:18,696
This is for you, Mr. Day.
Where shall I put it?

2094
01:46:18,779 --> 01:46:20,738
Oh, that's for me, I think.
Take it upstairs, Maggie.

2095
01:46:20,821 --> 01:46:23,487
Wait a minute, Maggie.
Bring it here. Let's see it.

2096
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:25,613
See, it's for me, father.
Clarence Day, Jr.

2097
01:46:25,696 --> 01:46:28,196
Let me look.
Well, that's from McCreery's.

2098
01:46:28,279 --> 01:46:29,946
It is marked charged.
What is it?

2099
01:46:30,029 --> 01:46:32,070
Clare, it's alright. It's
nothing for you to worry about.

2100
01:46:32,154 --> 01:46:34,613
Well, at least I think I should
know what's being charged to me.

2101
01:46:34,696 --> 01:46:36,946
- What is it?
- Clare, stop your fussing.

2102
01:46:37,029 --> 01:46:38,654
It's a new suit of clothes
for Clarence

2103
01:46:38,738 --> 01:46:41,112
and it isn't costing you
a penny.

2104
01:46:42,613 --> 01:46:44,529
It's marked "Charged $15."

2105
01:46:44,613 --> 01:46:47,696
It's costing me $15.
And I told Clarence--

2106
01:46:47,779 --> 01:46:51,404
'Clare, can't you take my word?
It isn't costing you a penny.'

2107
01:46:51,487 --> 01:46:54,362
I'd like to have you explain
why it isn't.

2108
01:46:54,446 --> 01:46:56,571
Because Clarence took
the pug dog back

2109
01:46:56,654 --> 01:46:58,321
and got the suit instead.

2110
01:46:58,404 --> 01:47:01,029
Of course, and they'll charge me
$15 for the suit.

2111
01:47:01,112 --> 01:47:03,279
Nonsense, Clare,
we gave them the pug dog

2112
01:47:03,362 --> 01:47:04,863
for the suit. Don't you see?

2113
01:47:04,946 --> 01:47:07,196
Then they'll charge me $15
for the pug dog.

2114
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:10,321
But, Clare, they can't.
We haven't got the pug dog.

2115
01:47:10,404 --> 01:47:12,738
- We sent that back.
- Well..

2116
01:47:14,154 --> 01:47:16,613
Hmm?

2117
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:19,154
But..

2118
01:47:19,237 --> 01:47:22,571
Well, now, wait a minute,
Vinnie.

2119
01:47:22,654 --> 01:47:24,821
The suit..

2120
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:26,487
The..

2121
01:47:26,571 --> 01:47:29,905
Well, there's something wrong
with your reasoning.

2122
01:47:29,987 --> 01:47:31,738
Well, Clare,
I'm surprised at you.

2123
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:34,279
And you're supposed to be
so good at figures.

2124
01:47:34,362 --> 01:47:36,029
Why, it's perfectly clear to me.

2125
01:47:36,112 --> 01:47:39,070
Vinnie, they're going to charge
me for one thing or the other.

2126
01:47:39,154 --> 01:47:41,446
Don't you let them!

2127
01:47:45,154 --> 01:47:48,029
Chaa! Well, McCreery's
aren't giving away suits

2128
01:47:48,112 --> 01:47:50,529
and they aren't giving away
pug dogs.

2129
01:47:50,613 --> 01:47:52,196
Why, it should be clear
to a child

2130
01:47:52,279 --> 01:47:55,029
that if Clarence sent
the pug dog back, they..

2131
01:47:57,112 --> 01:47:58,446
Well..

2132
01:48:00,654 --> 01:48:03,362
I will not have that
botanical freak in this room.

2133
01:48:03,446 --> 01:48:05,196
'John,
have you been going around'

2134
01:48:05,279 --> 01:48:06,529
'this town selling medicine?'

2135
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:09,362
- Yes, mother.
- Dog medicine?

2136
01:48:09,446 --> 01:48:11,321
No, mother.
Not dog medicine.

2137
01:48:11,404 --> 01:48:12,946
This letter
from Mrs. Sprague says

2138
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:14,821
you sold her
a bottle of this medicine

2139
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:17,696
and that her little boy
gave some of it to their dog

2140
01:48:17,779 --> 01:48:19,404
and it killed him.

2141
01:48:19,487 --> 01:48:22,029
Now she wants $10 from us
for a new dog.

2142
01:48:22,112 --> 01:48:23,905
Here, let me see that letter.

2143
01:48:23,987 --> 01:48:26,738
Well, he shouldn't have given it
to a dog. It's for humans.

2144
01:48:26,821 --> 01:48:28,613
Why, it's Bartlett's
Beneficent Balm

2145
01:48:28,696 --> 01:48:30,696
made from a secret formula.

2146
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:33,112
Have you been going around
among our friends and neighbors

2147
01:48:33,196 --> 01:48:34,613
selling some patent nostrum?

2148
01:48:34,696 --> 01:48:37,905
But it's good medicine, father.
I can prove that by mother.

2149
01:48:37,987 --> 01:48:39,321
Vinnie, what do you know
about this?

2150
01:48:39,404 --> 01:48:41,779
Well, nothing, Clare.
But I'm sure John--

2151
01:48:41,863 --> 01:48:44,654
- No, I mean that day mother--
- That's enough!

2152
01:48:44,738 --> 01:48:46,070
You're going to every house
where you sold

2153
01:48:46,154 --> 01:48:48,237
a bottle of that concoction
and buy it all back.

2154
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:50,070
But it's a dollar a bottle.

2155
01:48:50,154 --> 01:48:52,613
I don't care how much it is.
Here.

2156
01:48:52,696 --> 01:48:54,362
I'll give you the money now.

2157
01:48:54,446 --> 01:48:57,863
- How many bottles did you sell?
- One hundred and twenty eight.

2158
01:48:57,946 --> 01:48:59,279
One hundred and twenty eight?

2159
01:48:59,362 --> 01:49:00,863
Clare, I always told you

2160
01:49:00,946 --> 01:49:04,237
John would make
a good businessman.

2161
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:07,571
Young man, you'll have to
come down to my office with me.

2162
01:49:07,654 --> 01:49:09,946
I'll give you the money
to buy back that medicine.

2163
01:49:10,029 --> 01:49:13,404
$128, and $10 more
for Mrs. Sprague's dog.

2164
01:49:13,487 --> 01:49:15,905
That's $138.
Thank you, Vinnie.

2165
01:49:15,987 --> 01:49:17,946
But it's all coming
out of your allowance!

2166
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:19,613
That means that
you'll not get another penny

2167
01:49:19,696 --> 01:49:22,237
until the whole $138 is paid up.

2168
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:27,613
I'll be 21 years old!

2169
01:49:31,237 --> 01:49:32,779
Oh, God!

2170
01:49:32,863 --> 01:49:35,112
What the matter, Clare?
What's wrong?

2171
01:49:43,196 --> 01:49:44,905
Those gypsies are back.

2172
01:49:44,987 --> 01:49:46,987
Don't anyone answer the door!

2173
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:49,738
They're moving in on us again,
bag and baggage.

2174
01:49:49,821 --> 01:49:50,987
I won't have it, I tell you.

2175
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:52,779
- I won't have it!
- Now, Clare--

2176
01:49:52,863 --> 01:49:54,987
Don't let them in!

2177
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:56,696
'Clare, hush up.
They'll hear you.'

2178
01:49:56,779 --> 01:49:57,987
'Tell them to get back
in that cab'

2179
01:49:58,070 --> 01:49:59,446
'and drive right on to Ohio.'

2180
01:49:59,529 --> 01:50:01,696
'As if we could turn
our own relatives away.'

2181
01:50:01,779 --> 01:50:03,446
They're extravagant enough
to take cabs

2182
01:50:03,529 --> 01:50:04,905
when horse cars run
right by our door.

2183
01:50:04,987 --> 01:50:07,321
Clare, now you be quiet
and behave yourself.

2184
01:50:07,404 --> 01:50:08,821
John,
come help with the baggage.

2185
01:50:08,905 --> 01:50:10,279
Why do they always
have to pounce on us

2186
01:50:10,362 --> 01:50:11,321
without any warning?

2187
01:50:11,404 --> 01:50:12,863
Shh!

2188
01:50:12,946 --> 01:50:15,487
Cora, Mary.

2189
01:50:15,571 --> 01:50:18,321
Well, it's so good
to have you back again.

2190
01:50:18,404 --> 01:50:20,362
How are you, Vinnie?
We've been so worried about you.

2191
01:50:20,446 --> 01:50:23,112
Oh, I'm fine now.
Did you have fun in Springfield?

2192
01:50:23,196 --> 01:50:24,905
- Oh, it was wonderful.
- Was it?

2193
01:50:24,987 --> 01:50:27,696
John, my, you're still growing.

2194
01:50:27,779 --> 01:50:29,987
- Thank you, Cousin Cora.
- John, go get their baggage.

2195
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:31,613
- There's Whitney.
- Whitney.

2196
01:50:31,696 --> 01:50:34,070
- How are you, darling?
- Fine, thank you.

2197
01:50:34,154 --> 01:50:36,821
- And little Harlan.
- Hello.

2198
01:50:36,905 --> 01:50:40,237
- Have you been a good boy?
- No.

2199
01:50:40,321 --> 01:50:42,362
Clare, the girls are here.

2200
01:50:42,446 --> 01:50:46,029
Cousin Clare, here we are again.

2201
01:50:46,112 --> 01:50:48,237
My, my, it's so nice to be back.

2202
01:50:48,321 --> 01:50:50,029
- How do you do, Mr. Day?
- How do you do?

2203
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,696
Come in, sit down
and have some breakfast with us.

2204
01:50:51,779 --> 01:50:53,321
Oh, we had breakfast
at the depot.

2205
01:50:53,404 --> 01:50:55,362
Well, we've practically
finished ours.

2206
01:50:55,446 --> 01:50:56,905
I haven't finished my breakfast.

2207
01:50:56,987 --> 01:50:59,029
Well, then sit down, Clare.

2208
01:50:59,112 --> 01:51:01,029
Come have a cup of coffee,
anyway.

2209
01:51:01,112 --> 01:51:03,237
Mary, sit over there. Cora.

2210
01:51:03,321 --> 01:51:06,905
- Maggie, clear those places.
- My, my, this seems so natural.

2211
01:51:06,987 --> 01:51:09,863
Clare, don't let your kippers
get cold.

2212
01:51:09,946 --> 01:51:12,029
- Maggie, serve some coffee.
- Yes, ma'am.

2213
01:51:12,112 --> 01:51:14,279
Oh, where's Clarence?

2214
01:51:14,362 --> 01:51:16,446
Uh, he must be upstairs
moving his things

2215
01:51:16,529 --> 01:51:17,946
so you can have his room again.

2216
01:51:18,029 --> 01:51:20,237
Oh, oh, Vinnie,
we can't stay overnight.

2217
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:22,279
Grandpa Evans
has been failing very fast

2218
01:51:22,362 --> 01:51:23,905
and that's why
I have to hurry back.

2219
01:51:23,987 --> 01:51:26,779
We're leaving on the 5 o'clock
train this afternoon.

2220
01:51:26,863 --> 01:51:29,946
Well, Cora, it certainly
is good to see you again.

2221
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:37,070
Well, who can that be?

2222
01:51:37,154 --> 01:51:38,738
Well, this time
it can't be another

2223
01:51:38,821 --> 01:51:41,154
special delivery letter
for Clarence.

2224
01:51:41,237 --> 01:51:42,487
Uh, while you were
in Springfield

2225
01:51:42,571 --> 01:51:44,738
our postman
was kept pretty busy.

2226
01:51:46,821 --> 01:51:50,112
- It's the cab, ma'am.
- Cab? What cab?

2227
01:51:50,196 --> 01:51:52,404
The cab that's to take us
to Audubon Park.

2228
01:51:52,487 --> 01:51:54,863
Oh, who's going to Audubon Park?

2229
01:51:54,946 --> 01:51:56,279
We all are.

2230
01:51:56,362 --> 01:51:58,029
Cora, the most wonderful thing
has happened.

2231
01:51:58,112 --> 01:52:01,112
Clare is going to be baptized
this morning.

2232
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:08,237
Vinnie, what are you saying?

2233
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:12,154
'I'm saying you're going to be
baptized this morning.'

2234
01:52:12,237 --> 01:52:14,571
I am not going to be baptized

2235
01:52:14,654 --> 01:52:16,613
this morning
or any other morning!

2236
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:19,029
You promised yesterday
that as soon as I sent

2237
01:52:19,112 --> 01:52:21,112
that pug dog
that you'd be baptized.

2238
01:52:21,196 --> 01:52:22,987
I never said anything
remotely like that!

2239
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:25,487
Clarence was right there
and heard you.

2240
01:52:25,571 --> 01:52:27,863
That's why I ordered the cab.

2241
01:52:27,946 --> 01:52:29,154
The cab.

2242
01:52:30,654 --> 01:52:34,237
Vinnie,
you send that right back.

2243
01:52:34,321 --> 01:52:35,571
I'll do nothing of the kind.

2244
01:52:35,654 --> 01:52:37,946
I'm going to see
that you go to heaven.

2245
01:52:38,029 --> 01:52:40,613
- I can't go to heaven in a cab.
- Oh.

2246
01:52:42,404 --> 01:52:44,321
Oh!

2247
01:52:44,404 --> 01:52:46,487
Well, you can start in a cab.

2248
01:52:46,571 --> 01:52:48,571
I'm not sure they'll ever
let you into heaven.

2249
01:52:48,654 --> 01:52:51,029
But I know they won't
unless you're baptized.

2250
01:52:51,112 --> 01:52:53,738
They can't keep me out of heaven
on a technicality.

2251
01:52:55,571 --> 01:52:58,654
Clare, stop quibbling.
You may as well face it.

2252
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:01,279
You've got to make
your peace with God.

2253
01:53:01,362 --> 01:53:04,070
Until you stirred Him up,
I had no trouble with God.

2254
01:53:08,404 --> 01:53:10,946
Harlan, Whitney,
come get your Sunday hats.

2255
01:53:12,279 --> 01:53:13,987
- Clarence, John!
- 'Yes, mother?'

2256
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:16,029
Hurry, we're ready to go.

2257
01:53:16,112 --> 01:53:17,779
Oh, my prayer book.

2258
01:53:17,863 --> 01:53:19,863
Harlan, come let me fix
your tie.

2259
01:53:21,112 --> 01:53:23,029
Vinnie, are you mad?

2260
01:53:23,112 --> 01:53:24,696
Was it your plan
that my own children

2261
01:53:24,779 --> 01:53:25,987
should witness this indignity?

2262
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:29,446
Why, Clare,
they'll be proud of you.

2263
01:53:29,529 --> 01:53:32,029
I suppose
Harlan is to be my godfather.

2264
01:53:33,654 --> 01:53:36,237
Vinnie, I won't go through
with this thing. That's final.

2265
01:53:36,321 --> 01:53:38,362
Well, Clare dear,
if you feel that way about it--

2266
01:53:38,446 --> 01:53:39,529
I do!

2267
01:53:39,613 --> 01:53:41,279
Well, we won't take the children
with us.

2268
01:53:41,362 --> 01:53:42,946
I'm not talking
about the children.

2269
01:53:43,029 --> 01:53:45,863
- I'm ready, mother.
- Oh, John.

2270
01:53:45,946 --> 01:53:47,987
Vinnie, I haven't time for
anything like that this morning.

2271
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:49,696
I've got to take John
down to my office with me

2272
01:53:49,779 --> 01:53:51,654
and give him the money
to buy back that dog medicine.

2273
01:53:51,738 --> 01:53:53,738
But it wasn't dog medicine, sir.

2274
01:53:53,821 --> 01:53:55,863
Young man, we're starting
downtown this minute.

2275
01:53:55,946 --> 01:53:57,446
You'll do no such thing.

2276
01:53:57,529 --> 01:54:00,696
You gave me your sacred promise
that day I almost died.

2277
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:02,487
Yes, and she would have died
if we hadn't given her

2278
01:54:02,571 --> 01:54:05,237
some of that medicine.
That proves it's good medicine.

2279
01:54:06,821 --> 01:54:09,738
You gave your mother
some of that dog medicine?

2280
01:54:09,821 --> 01:54:12,070
- John, you didn't?
- Yes, we did, mother.

2281
01:54:12,154 --> 01:54:14,362
We put some in your tea
that morning.

2282
01:54:14,446 --> 01:54:16,154
Oh, John.

2283
01:54:18,237 --> 01:54:21,571
Do you realize you might have
killed your mother?

2284
01:54:21,654 --> 01:54:23,696
You did kill Mrs. Sprague's dog.

2285
01:54:25,779 --> 01:54:27,654
John, I'll have to give
considerable thought

2286
01:54:27,738 --> 01:54:29,029
as to how you are to be punished
for this.

2287
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,821
- But, Clare--
- No, Vinnie.

2288
01:54:30,905 --> 01:54:32,571
When I think of that day, what..

2289
01:54:32,654 --> 01:54:34,571
Why, we might have lost you.

2290
01:54:34,654 --> 01:54:36,362
You're alright now,
thank heaven.

2291
01:54:36,446 --> 01:54:38,321
But what I went through
that afternoon

2292
01:54:38,404 --> 01:54:39,279
the way I felt..

2293
01:54:39,362 --> 01:54:41,738
Well, I'll never forget it.

2294
01:54:41,821 --> 01:54:44,237
You've forgotten it already.

2295
01:54:44,321 --> 01:54:45,529
What do you mean?

2296
01:54:45,613 --> 01:54:46,863
That was the day you gave me

2297
01:54:46,946 --> 01:54:49,154
your sacred promise.

2298
01:54:49,237 --> 01:54:51,196
Yes, but I wouldn't have
given you my promise

2299
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:52,571
if I hadn't thought
you were dying.

2300
01:54:52,654 --> 01:54:54,029
And you wouldn't have
almost died

2301
01:54:54,112 --> 01:54:55,946
if John hadn't given you
that dog medicine.

2302
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:59,196
Don't you see? Well,
the whole thing is illegal.

2303
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:01,112
Suppose I had died.

2304
01:55:01,196 --> 01:55:03,446
It wouldn't make
any difference to you.

2305
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:05,946
You don't care whether
we meet in heaven or not.

2306
01:55:06,029 --> 01:55:09,112
You don't care whether you ever
see me and the children again.

2307
01:55:09,196 --> 01:55:12,446
Oh, Vinnie,
you're not being fair to me.

2308
01:55:12,529 --> 01:55:14,905
It's alright, Clare.

2309
01:55:14,987 --> 01:55:17,070
If you don't love us enough

2310
01:55:17,154 --> 01:55:19,279
there's nothing
we can do about it.

2311
01:55:19,362 --> 01:55:21,654
But that has nothing
to do with it.

2312
01:55:23,070 --> 01:55:26,196
I love my family
as much as any man.

2313
01:55:26,279 --> 01:55:29,279
All my life, I've struggled
and worked just to..

2314
01:55:30,987 --> 01:55:33,279
Oh, God, there's that cab.

2315
01:55:37,404 --> 01:55:40,654
Vinnie, y-you're not well enough
to go all the way to Audubon.

2316
01:55:40,738 --> 01:55:42,779
Oh, I'm well enough if we ride.

2317
01:55:42,863 --> 01:55:45,154
But that trip would take
all morning.

2318
01:55:45,237 --> 01:55:47,654
And those cabs cost
a dollar an hour.

2319
01:55:47,738 --> 01:55:49,446
This is one of their best cabs.

2320
01:55:49,529 --> 01:55:51,446
This costs $2 an hour.

2321
01:55:54,029 --> 01:55:57,029
Well, then why aren't you ready?
Get your hat on!

2322
01:55:57,112 --> 01:55:59,196
Oh, tarnation!

2323
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:02,362
Hallelujah! Amen!

2324
01:56:05,029 --> 01:56:06,446
Young lady,
if it hadn't been for you

2325
01:56:06,529 --> 01:56:08,946
no one would have known
whether I was baptized or not!

2326
01:56:26,196 --> 01:56:27,905
Oh, God!

2327
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:34,779
Good morning, Mr. Day.
Going to the office?

2328
01:56:34,863 --> 01:56:37,404
No! I'm going to be baptized!
