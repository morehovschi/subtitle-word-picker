﻿1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,320
This programme contains
some violent scenes and strong
language from the start

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,920
We're in the middle of a vendetta.
We need Luca Changretta dead!

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,920
We used to come here. Who? Some girl
before France.
What is that you want?

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,640
I want you to help my son
achieve his ambition.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,360
What do you have? Another enemy.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,120
Arthur Shelby killed her son
in a boxing ring.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,240
There's 15 Italians out there.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,320
There's 13,
I just killed two of them.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
The boy in the hospital's
out of bounds.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,920
And I'll ask you to spare
Finn and Arthur.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,720
In return for what?

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,080
Tommy Shelby.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,880
Tom.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,560
Good morning, Mrs Ross.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,360
Have a seat.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,240
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Shelby.
I know how busy you are.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
How can I help you?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Well, you see, tomorrow would have
been my son's 21st birthday...

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,080
..had he lived.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,240
And I'm having a bit of a thing -

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,200
just sandwiches and beer
and looking at old photos.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,080
And, as a gesture...

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,960
..I thought I would invite
your brother, Arthur.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
A gesture of what, Mrs Ross?

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,520
Not exactly forgiveness.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
But something like that.

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,120
And also it's a way of saying
thank you to the Shelby family

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,240
for helping me and my children
get by since the death of my Edward.

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
That's very kind of you.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,040
That's very kind.

31
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,440
I will let Arthur know.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400
It'll be at my house at midday.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,360
He should come at midday.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
Your house, midday tomorrow,
all right.

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
One of us will be there.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,720
It ought to be Arthur.

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
Goodbye, Mrs Ross.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
FOOTSTEPS RETREAT

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,680
MUSIC: Snake Oil
by Foals

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,440
All right, at midday today,
Arthur will be here.

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,280
47 Artillery Square.

42
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,960
Like a goat tied up for the fucking
tiger, eh, Arthur? Yeah, right.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,640
Dear Lord, forgive me.

44
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,360
But vengeance is forthcoming...

45
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,680
..and long overdue.

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Right. There are two ways
into Artillery Square.

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,640
One here, the towpath,
and here, Navigation Street.

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,960
Finn, take a rifle.

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,280
You'll be here, Finn,
covering the towpath.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,240
Most likely, they'll
come down Navigation Street.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,000
Johnny and Isaiah will set up here
as hawkers, selling stolen pork.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,760
When you get the signal from me,
you can open fire. From you, eh?

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,320
Yep, I'll be here,
in a window, overlooking.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,720
You still know what end
the bullets come out of, Tom?

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,440
ALL LAUGH

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,120
He knows.

57
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,240
But these men are coming
for my brother,

58
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,120
believing him to be unarmed
and unprotected.

59
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,560
So, this is my fucking business.

60
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,840
Arthur, let's go.

61
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,800
Keep alive, soldier.

62
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,920
DOOR OPENS

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,800
Just put them on the table.

64
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,760
Buy yourself bacon here, ribs,

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,640
cheek and tongue!

66
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,000
Plenty of trotter.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,680
Ribs, tongue and cheek, huh?

68
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Mr Shelby.

69
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm glad you could come.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,080
Thank you for the invitation.

71
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,560
So...

72
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
I don't allow firearms in the house.

73
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,200
It's a good thing I'm not carrying
a firearm, then, ain't it, Mrs Ross.

74
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,440
Do you mind if I check?

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,120
No.

76
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,560
Come in.

77
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,240
Take a seat.

78
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,080
Would you like some tea
while we wait, Mr Shelby?

79
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,960
What are we waiting for?

80
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,720
The other guests.

81
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,000
TEAPOT SHAKES

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,720
Threepence for the four, huh? >

83
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,880
VEHICLE APPROACHES

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
HE WHISTLES

85
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,160
WATER SPLASHES

86
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,720
So, where are these other guests?

87
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,960
They will be here very soon.

88
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,200
But in the meantime, there are some
things I want to say...

89
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,520
..before they get here.

90
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,160
By all means.

91
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,360
I've heard stories that you have
welcomed Jesus into your life.

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
I have indeed.

93
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
At the beseeching of your wife...
who they say is a good woman.

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,200
She is my shining light.

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
Though her mother,
by all accounts, was not.

96
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you think your repentance will
mean you are forgiven of your sins?

97
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,280
We both know that forgiveness
is out of my hands.

98
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,120
I mean, for murdering my son.

99
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
That was a sporting accident.

100
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,160
Because I have not yet found it
in my heart to forgive you.

101
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,680
And don't think I ever will.

102
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, then,
why have you invited me here today?

103
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,880
Hm?

104
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,880
Off you go now.

105
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,520
Why am I here, Mrs Ross?

106
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,000
Why did you invite me here today?

107
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,080
BOLT CLACKS

108
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,920
Too late to back out now! >

109
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,160
MEN CHATTER

110
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,200
Now, Johnny, fire! Move!

111
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
GUNSHOTS

112
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,040
It's a fucking decoy...

113
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,600
Bring the car round! Now!

114
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
What are you doing?

115
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,160
SCUFFLING

116
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,840
GUNSHOT

117
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
HE GROANS
Oh, shit!

118
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,960
Arthur!

119
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,520
Arthur!

120
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,800
They're not here for you!

121
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,240
It must be Michael!

122
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
You...!

123
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,160
You set me up, eh?

124
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You set me up!
SHE WHIMPERS

125
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,680
Unarmed.

126
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,680
Arthur, you need to get to the
hospital now! Fuck off!

127
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,120
SHE WHIMPERS

128
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,040
HE GROWLS

129
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,480
If your faith is real,

130
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,480
I've got other kids.

131
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,840
CRASHING

132
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,760
If you're here in one hour,

133
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,680
I swear to God...

134
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,080
..I will cover you in tar
and fucking feathers.

135
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,680
Come on, Finn, let's go!

136
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,640
SHE SOBS

137
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,880
HE GRUNTS

138
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Uh-uh-uh...

139
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,920
Where I'm from,

140
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,520
a hat on the bed's unlucky.

141
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
My family...

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
..say it brings death.

143
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,360
Maybe...

144
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,280
..maybe that's what happened...

145
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Last time my man was sent for you,
you got lucky.

146
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,240
Now...

147
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,880
..your luck's run out.

148
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,800
HE PRAYS SOFTLY

149
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
HE PANTS

150
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
EMPTY CLICK

151
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
CLICKS

152
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,440
CLICKS

153
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,560
CLICKS

154
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,520
And tell your mother...

155
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,560
..we have a deal.

156
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
Come here.

157
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,560
GUNSHOT

158
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,240
Michael?

159
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,840
What happened, eh? What happened?

160
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,280
They heard you, er,
heard you coming.

161
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,000
The gun misfired.

162
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
They ran away.

163
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Johnny!

164
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
You came just in time.

165
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,680
You all right? You all right?

166
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,840
Yeah, I'm fine.

167
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,280
Fine.

168
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,680
DOOR OPENS

169
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,640
Oi! Get out!

170
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,520
Small Heath, 333.

171
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,000
Charlie.

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,800
Listen, Bonnie Gold will be
calling in four minutes.

173
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
Tell him the Italians
are on the road south.

174
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,560
A Rolls-Royce. Maybe two. Black.

175
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,160
Tell him to expect
a full complement of men.

176
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
We inflicted no casualties.

177
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
I said, we inflicted
no fucking casualties.

178
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,040
REPLACES RECEIVER

179
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,880
HE EXHALES

180
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,160
There's been an accident.

181
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,000
Why don't you move it
out of the way? What?

182
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,000
I said, why don't you clear it,
so that we can get past?

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
What's that accent?

184
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,000
We're Americans.

185
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,120
We're here on business.

186
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,520
Well, you're going to have to wait.

187
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,600
Jesus Christ...

188
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,760
We waited for you fucking Yanks
until 1918.

189
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,880
It'll be clear in 20 minutes,
all right? Yeah, all right.

190
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,760
Thank you, Officer.

191
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
Thank... Fucking hell.

192
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,240
Talking about the war.

193
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,840
Everything here is about the war.

194
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Right, come on, let's go move it
ourselves. Fucking idiots!

195
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,840
What's this? Whose wagon is that?

196
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,760
They're gypsies.

197
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
A tribe of fucking gypsies.

198
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
Well, we can move it... Hey.

199
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,080
I said, it will be clear in
20 minutes.

200
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,160
Let's go.

201
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,560
We'll find another way out of here.

202
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,040
Go.

203
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,520
Get us the fuck out of here!

204
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Come on, fucking move!

205
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,240
Make a fucking move!

206
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
GUNSHOTS

207
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,760
Put the guns down!
Put the guns down!

208
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,200
GUNSHOT

209
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,440
HE GRUNTS

210
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,720
MICHAEL: He spared me.

211
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,200
He said, "Tell your mum
that we have a deal."

212
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
What deal?

213
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Just be you and me going
to Australia, Michael.

214
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
Think about that.

215
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,800
What deal, Mum?

216
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,200
What deal did you make
with Luca Changretta?

217
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,680
A deal to spare your life.

218
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
In return for what?

219
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,600
Men don't have
the strategic intelligence

220
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,360
to conduct a war between families.

221
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
Men are less good at keeping
secrets out of their lies.

222
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,800
You've agreed to give up Tommy...

223
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
..to save my life.

224
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,240
You never forgave him, did you?

225
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,640
We're out of our league.

226
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
No.

227
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,600
No, we don't do that to our own.

228
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
Think - if it wasn't for me,

229
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,080
you'd be smoke blowing
out of a mortuary chimney.

230
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,600
Think about that.

231
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,840
Nah, two.

232
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
We killed two.

233
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,760
You also shot a copper.

234
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,280
Shot in the arm.

235
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,720
With purpose.

236
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
There's a copper on the floor,

237
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,960
the Stratford Constabulary
will swarm all over it.

238
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,880
The copper's alive -
got a description of the Italians.

239
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,920
The Italians
will be forced underground.

240
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
We're gypsies.

241
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,560
We're already underground.

242
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,120
You, yourself, inflicted
no casualties this end, so...

243
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,840
You know, Mr Shelby...

244
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,320
..maybe you've been pushing pieces
of paper around too long.

245
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
Luca Changretta got away.

246
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
You let him get away.

247
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,320
When our paths cross,
I won't be so careless.

248
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,080
And when will your paths cross?

249
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
Soon.

250
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,080
If Her Majesty smells of paraffin,

251
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,400
it's because my old lamp
is smoking for want of fuel.

252
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,040
Times are hard,
in case you hadn't noticed.

253
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,160
I hope your insistence
that I take a boat,

254
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,040
rather than a cab, from the station,

255
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,760
wasn't purely for your own
amusement.

256
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,800
No. For the avoidance of
death or kidnap.

257
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,040
And by boat, you get to see
the nicer parts of a city.

258
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,880
You're in The Garrison now,
so you'll be all right. This way.

259
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,760
Morning, Lady Carleton.

260
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
I'm not a lady.

261
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,560
Too right, you're not.

262
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
For shoeing, stabling, feed,
and two hours a day in the gallops.

263
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,920
Did you think of a name?

264
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,160
Yes. Dangerous.

265
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,080
Dangerous, eh?

266
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,400
A horse called Dangerous
won the Epsom Derby in 1833.

267
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
So, I stole the name.

268
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,720
I thought you'd approve.
LIGHTER CLICKS

269
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,360
You should visit her. If I leave
Small Heath, I'll be shot dead.

270
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,160
Anyway, I'm busy.

271
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,920
Well, the good news is your horse
is the fastest filly

272
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,880
that I've ever ridden.

273
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,000
These are her registration papers.

274
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,200
Ready for your signature.

275
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
So, is this why you came here?

276
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
All this way, in person.

277
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
For my fucking signature?

278
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,040
You've lost your wife...

279
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,680
..and now your brother, too.

280
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,440
I thought it would make you
different.

281
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
But it doesn't seem to change you.

282
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,600
Nothing seems to change you.

283
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,120
DOOR OPENS

284
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,360
The end-of-year accounts for the
Grace Shelby Institute, Mr Shelby.

285
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
Begging pardon, madam.

286
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,640
I've already signed off
on those, Lizzie.

287
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,160
What do you think of his shirt?

288
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,120
He's having them made in London.

289
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm not sure about them.

290
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,160
All right, Lizzie, thank you.

291
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,000
But, you know, sometimes he sees
something glamorous and expensive

292
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,960
and he just can't resist it.
He's so weak.

293
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,720
Actually, speaking
of the Grace Shelby Foundation...

294
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
..I'd like to make a donation.

295
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,800
SHE CLEARS THROAT

296
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
I'll leave it blank.

297
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,800
You can decide how much, Mr Shelby.

298
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,960
Then, perhaps, Lizzie...?

299
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,560
You can pop to the bank
and pay it in for me.

300
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,280
That'll be all, Lizzie, thank you.

301
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,960
Drink?

302
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,680
No, thank you.

303
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,760
Did you pack an overnight bag?

304
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,800
No.

305
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
Pity.

306
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,760
Why?

307
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,280
Well, because 25 minutes ago,

308
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,320
the Birmingham branch
of the Train Drivers' Union

309
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,760
called a wildcat strike
in support of the coalminers.

310
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,680
No trains to London until tomorrow.

311
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,840
It wasn't in any of the papers.

312
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,720
That's why they call it a wildcat.

313
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,320
No-one knows.

314
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,240
Apart from you, of course.

315
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,440
Your city.

316
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,240
So, where will I stay in your city?

317
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,400
I'll be free at four.
I could meet you then.

318
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Meet and do what?

319
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,760
I will pour you some gin...

320
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,000
..that I make myself,
from my father's recipe.

321
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,880
Distilled for the eradication
of seemingly incurable sadness.

322
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,080
Going to put that on the label.

323
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I'll book myself a room.

324
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,520
Already done. The Midland. A suite.

325
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,800
I stay there myself sometimes.

326
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,120
Sometimes it's where you stay.

327
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,680
But not tonight, it would seem.

328
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,760
Well, since I'm stuck here,
maybe I should try your gin.

329
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,280
Four o'clock, then.

330
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,560
Where?

331
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,160
I'll find you.

332
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,520
What the fuck was that about,
Lizzie, eh?

333
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,680
Have a guess.

334
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:10,800
You know what, I can't even guess
any more. I'll be back at four.

335
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,520
Why is she still here?

336
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,840
Something to do with
the coalminers, apparently.

337
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,480
Today is your lucky day, sir.

338
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,640
Give you three to one
on Raging Robbers.

339
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,800
Come on, gents, get your bets on!

340
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,160
PHONE RINGS

341
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,640
Small Heath, 552.

342
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,800
Mrs Gray...

343
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,560
..I wanted to illustrate to you

344
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,800
that, at any time,
we can reach your son.

345
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,240
And we will kill your son...

346
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,480
..if you cannot deliver Tommy Shelby
as you promised, huh?

347
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,400
You just tell us where and when.

348
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,080
And we'll do the rest.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,360
SHE GASPS

350
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,360
Where is he?

351
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,000
Fucking.

352
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,240
Fucking what? Fucking her.

353
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,040
ã10,000? She left it blank.
So, I filled it in for her.

354
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,160
What's Tommy's diary looking like
for the rest of the week?

355
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,080
Fuck Tommy and his cock
and his gin...

356
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,480
..and his stuck-up whore.

357
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,160
I saved this. Read my leaves, Pol.

358
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,320
You haven't done my leaves in ages.

359
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,040
I haven't done anyone's
leaves for ages.

360
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,000
OK.

361
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
Pour.

362
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,000
Swirl the teacup.

363
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Think about the man you love.

364
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,680
Fuck him.

365
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,280
Think about your white wedding gown.

366
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,080
Now, pour the tea back into the pot.

367
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,840
OK, I'll read your tea leaves,

368
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,200
if you go and get Tommy's diary.

369
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,040
See if Tommy's got a free
afternoon in the next seven days.

370
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
Friday.

371
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,960
Now, read my future
and make it fucking good.

372
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,040
Make sure he keeps it free.

373
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,160
Just read my leaves, Pol.
I already have.

374
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,080
Plain as day.

375
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,440
What are you doing?

376
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,080
Stop drinking whisky.
Switch to stout.

377
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,480
Why?

378
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,040
Make sure Tommy
keeps that Friday free.

379
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,640
Tell him
I have an appointment for him.

380
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,040
And then go and see a doctor
about that baby in your tea leaves.

381
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,680
GRUNTS

382
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,680
Next.

383
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,200
You're not at the fucking
fairground now, son,

384
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,840
get down and skip me 200 for taking
the piss out of a fine fighter.

385
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,120
He's got a head on him, that boy.
And a fist.

386
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,280
So, what do you say, Mr Maine?

387
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,480
He works hard. He's game.

388
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,960
I'll need to work on his defence.

389
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,040
Right now, his left hand
is just good for wanking...

390
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,000
You don't have to earn your money.

391
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,560
We're paying you anyway.
Is he ready? Is he even registered?

392
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,120
I put him down as a welterweight,
Midlands Division.

393
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Amateur turning pro.

394
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,080
Just need your countersignature.

395
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,560
What, like, I'm going
to say "no" to you boys...

396
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,960
Just tell us, is he ready?

397
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,520
In 30 years, I've never seen
a raw boy so ready.

398
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,440
And that's 200, Mr Maine!

399
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,520
So, who am I fighting first,
Mr Shelby?

400
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,440
When you step in the ring, Bonnie,

401
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,400
who do you see across the canvas,
eh?

402
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,560
I see myself.

403
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,640
40 years old having done fuck
all except tramping the lanes.

404
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
I see my life wasted.

405
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,160
I won't let it happen.

406
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,240
Me, I'm going to be a champion.

407
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,880
Karna kova booti's kerred,

408
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,800
tute will vel the kralis
of the poov Romany chal.

409
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
Fight out at Camden Town.

410
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,120
Boy's name is Goliath.

411
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,440
He said he's at a meeting.

412
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,640
Yes, I was wondering, do you have
any boots that I could borrow?

413
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
Why do you need boots?
Well, no-one here will speak to me.

414
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,400
So, I thought I'd take
a walk by the canal.

415
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,320
Is he really making gin?

416
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,960
He's going mad cooped up here,
is what he is.

417
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,840
Like a wasp in a beer glass.

418
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,040
Ma'am.

419
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,000
You'll look a bit funny in these,
I think.

420
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,480
THEY CHUCKLE

421
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,360
Oh, thank you, Curly.

422
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,920
If you're going to take a walk along
the canal, you'll also need this.

423
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,840
Are you serious?

424
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,920
Italians north, Italians south.

425
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,000
He makes gin to take his mind
off being stuck inside a prison.

426
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,240
If you had any sense, Mrs Carleton,
you'd get out of here now.

427
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,720
Curly can sail you to Snow Hill
Station, hidden in the coal sacks.

428
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,680
I said I would wait.

429
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,120
The man you're waiting for
doesn't exist.

430
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,440
Wh-while you're waiting for the man
who doesn't exist,

431
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
would you like to try
some of his gin?

432
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,000
The strikers blocked
the Coventry Road,

433
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,920
made all the men get off the buses.

434
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,080
Where were the police?

435
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,440
They were busy.

436
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,280
Apparently, there was a report of
armed men in the Small Heath area,

437
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,600
and there was a murder
at the Summer Lane hospital

438
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,240
and something happening
on the Stratford Road.

439
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,120
The strikers threatened
the men's families.

440
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,560
They said, come the revolution,
their names would be on a list.

441
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,920
Like in Russia.

442
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,640
And the buses turned round.

443
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,800
Yes. They turned round.

444
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
Mr Shelby...

445
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,480
..factories are shut,

446
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,720
mines are shut,

447
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,600
coal's running out.

448
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,800
Did you ever consider the
possibility

449
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,560
that the communists might win?

450
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
And you and me,
traitors to our class,

451
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,360
will be put up against a wall
and shot.

452
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,040
As a businessman...

453
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,960
..I consider all possibilities.

454
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,040
But, Mr Devlin...

455
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,800
..I'm not a traitor to my class.

456
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,800
Small Heath, 551.

457
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,360
I am just an extreme example
of what a working man can achieve.

458
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,120
Hello, Ada, it's me.

459
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,720
I need your help.

460
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
♪ Hole in her sock
where her toe poked through... ♪

461
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
Four o'clock.

462
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,960
Is it?

463
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,280
What do you think?

464
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,520
Nice. A little sweet.

465
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,720
I've heard not sweet enough.

466
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,720
Come and see.

467
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,280
My God, Tommy.

468
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,720
What is this, a hobby?

469
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,680
No. I don't really have
time for hobbies.

470
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,040
This is more of a...

471
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,800
..more of a place
where I try things out.

472
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,400
I decided, if I'm going to be
stuck here in Small Heath,

473
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,600
I might as well
do something useful...

474
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,960
Less of a hobby.

475
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,440
More of a venture.

476
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,120
Since the start of Prohibition,

477
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,160
I've been sending single malt
Scotch whisky

478
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,800
to Boston, to Halifax, Nova Scotia,

479
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,080
hidden in crates of car parts.

480
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,640
SHE CHUCKLES

481
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,040
But my supply lines from Scotland
have been unreliable,

482
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,680
there's been a lot of thefts.

483
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,400
And in this modern age,

484
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,960
American women
drink as much booze as the men.

485
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,840
And women, apparently, prefer gin.

486
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,880
So, with the help of a friend of
mine in Camden Town,

487
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,880
I've set up my own source of supply.

488
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,040
Junipers, potatoes...

489
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,960
..sugar and water.

490
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,800
All turned into US dollars.

491
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
When we're up and running, we'll
produce over 200 gallons a week.

492
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
But before then...

493
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,440
..I need to get my recipe right.

494
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,200
So, tell me the truth.

495
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,560
The truth?

496
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,840
Mm-hm.

497
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,680
You're unlike any man
I have ever met.

498
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,920
And the gin?

499
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,160
Too sweet.

500
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,920
You said you'd booked a room.

501
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,440
No, I booked a suite.

502
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,440
Thank you.

503
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,160
If you book a taxi, I'll go.

504
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,280
You're a businessman, Tommy.
A good one.

505
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,120
If only you could...

506
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,560
If only I could what?

507
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,360
"If only you could change"?
Go on, say it!

508
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,400
If only you could change the bad.

509
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,080
And "the good" is laying
off 1,000 men.

510
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,720
Which I do, like a good businessman.

511
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,200
And I do it like that.

512
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,360
HE CLICKS FINGERS

513
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
And people go hungry.

514
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,080
And the bad... The bad's a fucking
win on the horses and a gun

515
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,840
and some fucking self-respect.

516
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,720
You fucking people...!

517
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,440
You bite like your horse.

518
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,600
We don't trust taxis any more.

519
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,440
Come with me.

520
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,080
There you go, brother.

521
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,440
Home sweet home.

522
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,680
A place for you to bring women back,
bring your mates.

523
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,360
Play games, gamble, cards... And you
keep an eye on our back yard.

524
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,720
It's Artillery Square,

525
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,760
the place is full of communists
and strikers.

526
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,840
Having a Shelby round here
will keep them in order.

527
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,480
Light the fucking fire.

528
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,880
Take some of this shit
off the walls.

529
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Curly'll be over later
with some poison for the rats.

530
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,800
Arthur?

531
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,840
This morning...

532
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,080
..I wouldn't have been able to pull
that trigger. I know I wouldn't.

533
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
They would have just walked past.

534
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,960
I'm not John.

535
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,120
I know I'm not. All right.

536
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,160
All right, brother.

537
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,440
I know you're not.

538
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,880
I know.

539
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,280
In the end, it's God who pulls
that fucking trigger anyway.

540
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,520
We don't get to decide who lives
and who dies, Finn.

541
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,120
Not us.

542
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,480
You just have to flick a switch...

543
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,120
..in your head.

544
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,320
Charlie said it wasn't safe
to walk by the canal.

545
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,960
He's right.

546
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
"Italians north and south," he said.

547
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,680
Nah, it's mostly chancers.

548
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,000
Local kids trying to get famous.

549
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,120
Sabini's boys.

550
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,600
Sheffield boys.
Manchester, Glasgow.

551
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,920
They all know we're on the ropes.

552
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,840
And that's not including the Mafia.

553
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,200
Yeah.

554
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,480
Here's your carriage.

555
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,920
You can catch
the 7.15 train.

556
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,960
I thought there was a strike.

557
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
What gave you that idea?

558
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,240
My God...

559
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,960
I know. The bad I can't help.

560
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,960
I wanted you to stay.

561
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,600
Normally, I get me own way.

562
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,680
Losing, occasionally, makes me
worse.

563
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
Thank you, Curly.

564
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,480
She looks a picture
in my boots, doesn't she, Tom?

565
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,600
Walk her to the train, Curly.

566
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,360
Yeah.

567
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,400
WOMAN: Not a minute on the day,
not a penny off the pay.

568
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,760
This talk of national austerity,

569
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,520
this talk of tightening our belts

570
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,880
must be met
with resolute certainty.

571
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,320
We will not accept any cuts in pay.

572
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,000
We will not accept working
longer hours for the same wage!

573
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,480
Shoulder to shoulder with the
coalminers, dock workers,

574
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,040
railway men and steel workers,

575
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,040
we will stand united through
the storm

576
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,120
that is surely coming to our city!

577
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,960
CHEERING

578
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,680
CHATTER

579
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,080
Jessie Eden?

580
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,720
Yes?

581
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,560
I'd like to buy you a drink.

582
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,040
I'm afraid the pubs around here
don't allow unaccompanied female
drinkers.

583
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm sure we'll be fine.

584
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,360
I know you from somewhere.

585
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,800
I'm Ada Thorne.

586
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,720
Formerly Shelby.

587
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,560
I have a settlement proposition

588
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,760
that my brother's too arrogant
and proud to offer to you in person.

589
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,120
HUM OF CONVERSATION

590
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,800
SILENCE DESCENDS

591
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,040
Sorry, ladies, we don't...

592
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,960
Don't what?

593
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,280
It's all right. I'm sorry.
I didn't...

594
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,600
"What are you drinking, ladies?"
That's what you're supposed to say.

595
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,320
Yes. Sorry.

596
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,960
Er, what are you drinking?

597
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,600
Beer. Pint.

598
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,480
And a whisky on ice.

599
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,680
I'm afraid we don't have ice.

600
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,360
Next time make sure you have ice.

601
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,400
This pub's come to our attention
for its lack of ice.

602
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,080
There's more than one way
to achieve equality.

603
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,920
Before you begin
to congratulate yourself,

604
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,000
I'm not impressed with your power
to terrify people.

605
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,960
Whereas I am impressed
by your ability to stand up

606
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,200
in front of an audience and speak.

607
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,080
I was never able to do it.

608
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,240
I've heard people talk about you.

609
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,320
You used to advocate
armed revolution...

610
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,000
Shelby Company Limited
is prepared to offer parity

611
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,200
for male and female workers across
all the factories in our ownership

612
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,120
and withdraw the pay cut for men.

613
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,200
In return for what?

614
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,480
In return for something
very unusual.

615
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,600
But very typical of my brother.

616
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,400
What does he want?

617
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,640
To sit down with you and talk.

618
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,000
If he withdraws his pay cut,
we've no need to talk.

619
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,920
He wants to talk about socialism
and revolution.

620
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,240
Dear God, are you serious?

621
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,400
My brother's a bookmaker.

622
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,080
Bookmakers hedge their bets.

623
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,200
Sometimes long shots come in.

624
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,320
And because
we emptied his buses today,

625
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,680
he thinks we are among
the runners and riders?

626
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,120
Beneath it all, my brother's a
very rational man.

627
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,880
Beneath all what?
You mean, beneath the beatings,

628
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,480
the cuttings, the shootings, the
murders... Yeah. Beneath all that.

629
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,400
Tell your brother that,
when we take power,

630
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,080
all means of production
will be owned by the workers.

631
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Essential industries
will be taken into state control.

632
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,520
Birmingham Town Hall is a rather
beautiful building

633
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,760
and we plan to preserve it.

634
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,000
What else does he need to know?

635
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,000
It's going to happen.

636
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,600
Aren't you a bit sorry
you jumped ship too soon?

637
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,960
He wants to take you for dinner.

638
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,720
I really have nothing to wear.

639
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,440
You'd need to wear boots.

640
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,480
He's suggesting dinner
in a scrap metal yard.

641
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,360
He said you'd appreciate
the sentiment.

642
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,440
If you don't show up,
the offer of parity is withdrawn.

643
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,760
This is not how you conduct
union business. Well...

644
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,960
..we must all make personal
sacrifices for the good of the good
old cause.

645
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,160
Right?

646
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,920
VEHICLE PULLS UP

647
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,280
Right.

648
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,880
Fucking hell, it smells of
pig round here, don't it?

649
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,720
Definitely not kosher.

650
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,200
"Come to Small Heath,

651
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,000
"you will go to hell...
for fucking breathing."

652
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,040
Where is everyone?

CAR SPRINGS GROAN

654
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,000
Fuck me, looks like he's grown
since we left London.

655
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,600
He's like a mushroom, in't he? He
grows in the dark. I need a piss.

656
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,360
Do ya? Yeah, well,
the place is a shithole.

657
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,920
Yeah, so, why don't you just
knock yourself out?

658
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,920
Where is everyone?

659
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,480
Ishmael, please, will you hit
the call to prayer?

Well, hit it!

00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,840

666
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,440
Morning, Alfie.
Yeah, it is, it is.

667
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,000
So, how come everybody's
in fucking bed?

668
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,960
So, this must be Goliath.

669
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,360
Right.

670
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,840
Let me introduce you to David.

671
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,920
This way, boys.

672
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,640
I assume that David's out of bed?!

673
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,480
Oh, right, the problem,
right, between rum and gin, yeah,

674
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,560
is that gin, right,
it leads to the melancholy.

675
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,080
Whereas rum incites violence,

676
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,320
it also allows you to be
liberated from your self-doubt.

677
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,760
I hear you're probably more in need
of the old rum

678
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,320
at the moment,
rather than gin, mate.

679

FLUTTERING ABOVE

680
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,320
Oh, dear. Brother, you've got
fucking starlings, mate.

681
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,000
You know that?
That shit will rot your pipework.

682
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,680
These bastards only understand one
language... It's all right, Alfie.

683
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,640
There is no need.

684
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,720
It's all right, I'm, er...
I'm getting a kestrel.

685
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,040
I hear that you've
got Italians, mate.

686
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,600
You got a kestrel for them
and all? Yes.

687
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,600
I'll have a kestrel for them, as
well.

688
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,160
Well, everything
is confirmed, in't it?

689
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,000
Yeah, weakness behind the eyes,

690
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,800
didn't to blink too much, all right?

691
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,240
You smell of smoke

692
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,200
and coal and horses.

693
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,720
You are back where
you belong, Tommy.

694
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,440
I know you don't touch it.
But you have a good nose.

695
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,440
Right, well, you've got to ask
yourself, seriously, though,

696
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,200
you know, did I even want
to piss and shit indoors?

697
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,360
Or was I actually born
that I were to defecate in fields

698
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,560
and the outhouses. This is a serious
issue though, Tommy.

699
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,280
Cos your people, your class

700
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,760
and my religion
is quiet similar actually

701
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,960
because you just cannot wash it out,

702
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,640
right, because
it come out your mother's tits.

703
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,240
Hm, no.

704
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,080
The Americans want it sweeter.

705
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,640
What have you heard, Alfie?

706
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,840
I heard a copper got shot.
Who shot him? My kestrel.

707
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,400
Right, I'll up the stakes, very
good.

708
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,160
Where are the Sicilians?

709
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,240
They're still using Sabini
for vehicles and for places to stay.

710
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,560
And reinforcements? Ah, no,

711
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,160
they're Sicilians, aren't they,
they don't trust nobody

712
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,760
who ain't fucked a goat on the
morning of their first pubic hair.

713
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,440
They've got traditions.

714
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,640
How many are here? 11.

715
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,600
Enough to drop a man who wrapped his
balls in an OBE till they fell off.

716
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,720
Well, the real question is, Alfie,

717
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,680
which side are you playing for, eh?

718
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,520
No.

719
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,400
Fucking hell.

720
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,680
What kind of world is it
to bring up children

721
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,720
when your own mate
can ask you that question, hey?

722
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,920
But the truth is, Tommy, you're
going to be fucking dead soon.

723
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,880
Yeah, and then, your starlings,
right,

724
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,160
they will peck out your blue
eyes, won't they,

725
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,600
and the jackdaws, they will steal
your gold and your medals,

726
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,960
and pretty soon, it'll be as if

727
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,920
you'd never even
fucking happened, right?

728
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,480
Tommy, here... There are men
approaching. Yeah, let 'em pass.

729
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,800
Right, you tell Darby Sabini
from me,

730
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,680
that if the Italians win,
they're not planning on leaving.

731
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,360
After me, it'll be him,

732
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,240
then you, then the Titanic.

733
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,880
They're the fucking Mafia, Alfie.

734
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,800
They've come here and can't
believe our coppers are unarmed.

735
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,040
They can distil their liquor
and it's not against the law.

736
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,320
They've come here
and they like what they see.

737
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,640
They're coming
and they're here to stay.

738
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,360
Mr Shelby? We've come to talk
purse for the fight.

739
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,520
Your kestrel? Hm?

740
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,000
Tommy, when a pikey walks
in with hair like that,

741
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,560
you've got to ask yourself,
"Have I made a mistake?"

742
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,560
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck am I?

743
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,560
Who the fuck is this?

744
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,720
I, my friend...

745
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,440
I am the uncle,
the protector and the promoter

746
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,760
of that fucking thing right there,

747
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,000
in whose shadow nothing good
nor godly will ever fucking grow.

748
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,240
That, there, right, is the Southern
Counties Welterweight Champion.

749
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,400
He is of mixed religion,
therefore he is godless.

750
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,320
He was adopted by Satan himself,

751
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,800
before he was returned
out of fear of his awkwardness,

752
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,040
he is impossible to marry off,
due to his lethal dimensions.

753
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,520
his mother terrified,
she's fucking abandoned him.

754
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,800
And there he is, stood before you,

755
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,600
like the first of some
brand-new fucking species!

756
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,200
Any man that you put before him,

757
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,480
right, it'd be like entering
a fucking threshing machine, mate.

758
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,360
Now...will you offer your son?

759
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,760
Name the day, Mr Shelby.

760
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,160
That's me finished
for the weekend, Tommy? Yeah.

761
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,200
Your mother wants me to
go to the Foundation. Prize-giving.

762
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,800
Just you?

763
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,240
Just me.

764
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,360
Why?

765
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,840
No reason.

766
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,480
No reason.

767
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,520
No reason.

768
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,640
Bye, Michael.

769
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,520
Tommy?

770
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,560
Yeah?

771
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,640
Have a good weekend.
