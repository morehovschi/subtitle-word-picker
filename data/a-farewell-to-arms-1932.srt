1
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:57,476
Driver.

2
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,319
- Driver, stop!
- What troubles you in there?

3
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,238
Why do you want to stop?

4
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,449
The man up there,
he is bleeding to death.

5
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,160
Can't stop. Not here.

6
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,653
Brakes won't hold.

7
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,204
Orderly.

8
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,196
Orderly!

9
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:12,174
And just as guilty as
a soldier would be,

10
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,718
who deserted his post under fire.

11
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,087
Now, in making an
example of you, I...

12
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:26,019
I beg your pardon, sir. I have some
wounded outside. I am looking for the...

13
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,980
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You want the Italian unit.

14
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:30,565
We're the English here, you see.

15
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,274
Yes, Number 207.

16
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:34,026
They're in the other wing.
Moved in today.

17
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:37,196
Yes, out that way, straight ahead.

18
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,773
- Thank you, Major.
- Hmm.

19
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,111
Shh!

20
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,370
Tut-tut!

21
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,970
What's the girlfriend been doing?

22
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,933
Typical male conceit!

23
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,284
I think they're going
to send her back home.

24
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:31,410
That's a dirty shame.

25
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,537
- She'll be disgraced.
- It's regulations.

26
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,163
At least they might let
her have her baby here.

27
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,999
If they send her back now,
all her friends will know.

28
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,793
- And her family.
- She's only herself to blame.

29
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,411
This is war, Fergy,
and she loved him.

30
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,916
Shh, here they come.

31
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,265
Well, is it necessary for us
all to be here at one time?

32
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,642
Get back to your posts.

33
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:03,804
You will be packed and ready
to leave within the hour.

34
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:07,474
Molly?

35
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,779
Can I help you pack?

36
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,781
I guess so. If you want to.

37
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,442
Why, of course I want to.

38
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,579
- Good girl.
- I beg your pardon?

39
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,907
I say, she's the only human
being in the whole lot of us.

40
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,586
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears
to sympathise with one

41
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:34,080
who has disgraced the
uniform we all wear.

42
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:53,064
- Baby!
- Rinaldi!

43
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:56,525
- Frederico!
- Get away. You're filthy.

44
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:59,570
You Anglo-Saxons!
You're not too clean yourself.

45
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,613
Did you bring me some
good cases, baby?

46
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:02,697
Did you have trouble finding us?

47
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:03,865
- No.
- How do you feel?

48
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,367
- Is there going to be an offensive?
- There's not...

49
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,202
Were you under fire? Madonna,
but I worried about you!

50
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:10,371
Yes, I can see how much
you've been worrying.

51
00:06:10,372 --> 00:06:14,958
Seven operations today, baby.
And one of them was beautiful.

52
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,452
I took the heart out.

53
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,755
It lay in my hand and
it beat like this.

54
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:24,249
You should have seen it.
It was lovely!

55
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,386
Soon, Rinaldi will be the best
surgeon in all the corps.

56
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,139
Then, in all the army.
And some day, in all of Italy.

57
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,391
- Why not in all the world?
- Why not?

58
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,395
You will like it here, baby.

59
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,354
What sort of a town
is this? Any girls?

60
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,564
Many beautiful English nurses.

61
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:44,734
- No, I mean, girls.
- Girls, too, a house full of them.

62
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,985
Another Villa Rossa?

63
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,695
Some of them have never
been to the front before.

64
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:49,905
Perhaps.

65
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:53,700
But the nurses are much nicer.
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley.

66
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:56,111
I am in love with her.

67
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,538
- Does she know it?
- Not yet.

68
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,290
- Have you any money?
- Yes.

69
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,667
- Lend me 50 lire.
- What for?

70
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:05,210
I want to make on Miss Barkley
the impression of a man

71
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:06,795
of sufficient wealth.

72
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,004
- All right.
- Thank you.

73
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:10,924
You are my great and good
friend and financial protector.

74
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,508
And you're an ass.

75
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,093
And now we will eat and drink,

76
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:16,094
and I will take you
to meet Miss Barkley.

77
00:07:16,095 --> 00:07:19,347
But you must make for me
a good impression upon her.

78
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,682
Now, listen...

79
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,935
But you must. And you
can have a nurse, too.

80
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:25,603
There is another one
named Miss Ferguson.

81
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:27,479
She is also very, very nice.

82
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,598
- No.
- "No"?

83
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,276
First, we will eat and drink,

84
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:36,988
and then we'll go and see the girls who
have never been to the front before.

85
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,898
Yes?

86
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,483
Yes.

87
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,337
You know what an American is?

88
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:56,488
- Yes.
- What is it?

89
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,700
She doesn't know.

90
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:05,387
- Well, I'm an American.
- Then what are you doing here?

91
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:09,516
- Drinking, mostly.
- He liked the uniform.

92
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:11,226
Wrong.

93
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:13,311
I liked their language.

94
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,606
Then what were you doing in Italy?

95
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:18,316
Studying.

96
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,517
Studying what?

97
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,270
Architecture.

98
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,821
You know what that is?

99
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:26,781
- Yes.
- What?

100
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:33,321
You see, she doesn't know.

101
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:38,700
- Neither do I.
- Oh, you've had too much wine.

102
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,127
It's filthy wine.

103
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:44,005
It takes the enamel off your teeth and
leaves it on the roof of your mouth.

104
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,873
- Where was I?
- Architecture.

105
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,426
Oh, yes. Look...

106
00:08:49,427 --> 00:08:51,587
I'll explain.

107
00:08:52,554 --> 00:08:56,257
This, my dear, is called an arch.

108
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:49,895
The arch, my dear, is perhaps the
oldest of architectural devices.

109
00:09:49,896 --> 00:09:52,389
Arch. Architecture.

110
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:57,402
The very word will tell you how
inextricably the two are one.

111
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:58,695
In a word, my dear,

112
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:02,990
architecture is the most
ancient of the arts.

113
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:07,110
Just as yours is the most
ancient of the professions.

114
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:11,406
You'd better put your shoe on,
or you'll get cold feet.

115
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:17,878
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.

116
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,964
Catherine!

117
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,998
Catherine!

118
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,968
- Catherine!
- Here I am, Fergy. I'm coming.

119
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,845
- Oh, I worried. Oh!
- Oh.

120
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:29,763
- You think I'd been blown away?
- I didn't know what to think.

121
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:31,557
Nobody saw where you went.

122
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,842
Who's that man?

123
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:37,304
Oh, I don't know.
Some lunatic. Come on.

124
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,655
What if we take the
mountains to the north?

125
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,782
Behind them are more mountains,
and behind those, more yet.

126
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:55,410
And we take them all only if
the Austrians stop fighting.

127
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,037
One side must stop.

128
00:10:57,038 --> 00:11:00,490
- Stop? It will go on forever.
- Like him.

129
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:13,551
The Priest wants the
Austrians to win the war.

130
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:16,971
- No, no, no. It is not true.
- But you don't want us to attack.

131
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:20,933
If we must have war,
I suppose we have to attack.

132
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:23,144
Oh, but so many die that way.

133
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,646
But what is death to a Christian.

134
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:39,358
Don't encourage him, Fergy.

135
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,160
Frederico.

136
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,953
- Oh, you are back safe.
- Hello, Father.

137
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,747
- I am so glad.
- The Priest prayed for you, Frederico.

138
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:50,417
- Every time you go out he does the same.
- Oh, I pray for you all.

139
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,003
You are late, baby.
How is it up there? Quiet?

140
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,464
You nearly missed the party.
But it is very dull.

141
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,675
But Miss Barkley is here,
and her friend Miss Ferguson.

142
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:02,669
The one you will like. Come.

143
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:09,350
Miss Barkley, permit
me to present to you

144
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:12,227
my friend and war brother,
Lieutenant Henry.

145
00:12:12,228 --> 00:12:14,688
He has just returned
back from the front.

146
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:18,024
How do you do?

147
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:21,069
And this is Miss Ferguson.

148
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,696
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

149
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,949
Now he begins again, that fellow.

150
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,110
Quick, let us go into the garden.

151
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,885
Now, you stay here.

152
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:54,473
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?

153
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,350
- Which do you like?
- All of them.

154
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,469
Then you shall have all of them.

155
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:18,610
- Nice out here.
- Hmm, isn't it?

156
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:25,125
We seem fated to bump into
each other in the dark.

157
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,336
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook you for someone else.

158
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:30,580
So I gathered.

159
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:34,458
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that, too.

160
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,668
- Mad?
- No.

161
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,179
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

162
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,765
Well, then what are you
doing in the Italian army?

163
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:46,101
It's not really the army,
it's only the ambulance.

164
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:48,896
It's very odd, though.
Why did you do it?

165
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,855
I don't know. Why did you?

166
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:53,274
Oh, I joined up in England.

167
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:57,186
Besides, the boy I was
engaged to had gone across.

168
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:05,701
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?

169
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:08,278
Yes, do bring her out,
Captain Rinaldi.

170
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,583
- Have some?
- Thanks.

171
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:26,762
He's sore.

172
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:28,138
What for?

173
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,140
Because I'm here with you.

174
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:33,009
Women prefer him, as a rule.

175
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:39,348
Shall we take a walk?

176
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,224
Yes, let's.

177
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:45,611
Where is he now?

178
00:14:45,612 --> 00:14:48,405
- Who?
- The boy you're engaged to.

179
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,825
- He's dead.
- Oh.

180
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:53,160
He was killed in the Somme.

181
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:54,828
Were you engaged long?

182
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:57,288
Eight years. We grew up together.

183
00:14:57,289 --> 00:14:59,290
Why didn't you marry?

184
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,743
I didn't know what the
war was like then.

185
00:15:02,877 --> 00:15:07,289
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him, or anything.

186
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:17,181
When I joined up,
I remember having this silly idea

187
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,016
that he might come to the
hospital where I was,

188
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:23,353
with a sabre cut, I suppose,
and a bandage around his head.

189
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:27,022
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

190
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:29,859
This is a picturesque front.
Not France.

191
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,527
He didn't have a sabre cut.

192
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:35,104
They blew him to bits.

193
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,947
What are you thinking about now?

194
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,116
About whisky.

195
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,950
What about whisky?

196
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,411
About how nice it is.

197
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,621
And you're nice, too.

198
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,752
No.

199
00:16:38,753 --> 00:16:40,128
- Why not?
- No, don't.

200
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,455
- Yes.
- No, please!

201
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:50,094
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

202
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,555
It's all right.

203
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:54,465
I'm dreadfully sorry. Really.

204
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:59,762
I... I just couldn't bear the
nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.

205
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,273
It's quite all right.
I don't mind at all.

206
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,941
Poor man.

207
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:09,186
You see, I've been leading
a funny sort of life.

208
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,281
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

209
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:16,693
You don't have to talk a lot
of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

210
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,321
We could get along.

211
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,390
Couldn't we?

212
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,249
You're sweet.

213
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,411
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

214
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:32,916
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

215
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,666
You are looking for someone?

216
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,586
- Have you seen Miss Barkley?
- Miss Barkley?

217
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:18,881
- Didn't she go out there with you?
- With me?

218
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:22,375
- No, no, no.
- But just a little while ago...

219
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:25,845
I thought I saw her go
out to the garden gate

220
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:26,971
with the Lieutenant Henry.

221
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,640
She went out with an officer? Alone?

222
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,268
Well, perhaps I was mistaken,
you know, it is quite dark out there.

223
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:34,728
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

224
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,888
No. No, I am sure I was mistaken.

225
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,808
Where is she, then?

226
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,155
You're a grand girl.

227
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,864
I'm a crazy girl.

228
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:50,366
- Why?
- To stay out here.

229
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,277
It's nice. Isn't that enough?

230
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,544
Hmm, it's nice. I suppose
that has to be enough

231
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:05,379
for people who are living as we live.

232
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,007
Back home, I'd have courted
you and sent you flowers.

233
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:11,502
Out here, you crowd
it all into one hour.

234
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:15,880
Isn't that the way it's
got to be, out here?

235
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,007
Look...

236
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:22,727
Tomorrow morning I've got
to go up to the front again.

237
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,098
And if a shell got me and
you never saw me again,

238
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:33,937
then we'd both be sorry that
we've been so formal and waited.

239
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,159
Besides, what's there so fine in
putting it off, dragging it out,

240
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,244
- giving me your lips tonight...
- No...

241
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,829
- ...your throat tomorrow...
- No.

242
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,115
No, wait. No, please... No...

243
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:57,124
Catherine?

244
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,387
Thanks for the lovely concert.

245
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:03,930
- I...
- I hope you are not worried

246
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:05,098
about Miss Barkley.

247
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,183
It's not like her to
disappear this way.

248
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:09,643
Well, perhaps she felt ill
and went home alone.

249
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,729
Perhaps. Good night.

250
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,139
Come, girls, come.

251
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:23,948
Why didn't you tell me?

252
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:26,117
It doesn't matter.

253
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:28,285
If it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

254
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:29,453
I couldn't know.

255
00:20:29,454 --> 00:20:31,955
In a church or out under the stars.

256
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:35,791
- Well, why not?
- "Why not"? There's a war on.

257
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:39,662
And tonight, who cares,
and tomorrow, who knows.

258
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:44,633
What did you say your name was?

259
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,751
Stop it.

260
00:20:48,637 --> 00:20:50,763
If you...

261
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:55,592
If you knew how I was back home,
you'd see the funny side of it.

262
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:57,644
Please, stop it.

263
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,684
Oh!

264
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:09,530
We blame everything on
the war, but that's rot.

265
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:12,398
It's something in ourselves.

266
00:21:16,077 --> 00:21:22,115
The lady sat in the public square
and mourned her lost innocence.

267
00:21:23,293 --> 00:21:25,459
Don't be sorry.

268
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,536
I'm not.

269
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,206
I love you.

270
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:35,377
Oh, darling.

271
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:59,999
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?

272
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,701
You made progress with her, eh?

273
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,703
We're friends.
If that's what you mean.

274
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:06,204
I mean, uh...

275
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:09,540
Was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

276
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,167
- Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy,

277
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:14,544
- but was she...
- Rinaldi!

278
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:16,379
Will you please shut up?

279
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,548
If you wanna be a
friend of mine, shut up.

280
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:21,884
I am your best friend
and your war brother.

281
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,085
Then shut up.

282
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,674
Miss Barkley prefers you
to me. That is very clear.

283
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:34,219
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.

284
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,806
You like her?

285
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:38,765
No.

286
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,011
That you of all people...

287
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:15,430
A lot of geese, that's what
you are! Silly geese!

288
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:18,767
Stuffed with bunk about
woman's part in the war.

289
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:21,102
We must bring solace
to the men who fight,

290
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:24,122
sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.

291
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:29,484
If you'd known him for a long time,
or been in love with him...

292
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:32,320
But you only met him tonight.

293
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:36,157
How long must you know a
man before you can love him?

294
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:39,026
Are you pretending to be
in love with that man?

295
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,987
I think I am, Fergy.

296
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,239
I must be.

297
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,825
Or it couldn't have happened.

298
00:23:48,085 --> 00:23:50,127
You're just another conquest to him.

299
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,837
One in a hundred.

300
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:55,165
You'll probably never see him again.

301
00:23:56,301 --> 00:24:00,970
He said if he'd met me back home,
he'd have courted me,

302
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:03,347
sent me flowers...

303
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:05,424
But now...

304
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,928
I suppose I won't ever see him again.

305
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:38,211
Ciao, baby.

306
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:39,954
Good luck.

307
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,251
- Turn back.
- Back?

308
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:25,327
Yes, back!

309
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:59,323
- I wanna see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

310
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,025
Wait, you can't go in there.

311
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:26,096
Hey, why have you come
back in here for?

312
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,599
The Tenente, he knows
what he's doing. Please.

313
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here?

314
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,019
We got plenty of time.

315
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,262
Oh, the...

316
00:26:34,522 --> 00:26:36,397
I thought you started.
What are you doing here?

317
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:40,234
We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something.

318
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,977
Oh.

319
00:27:02,546 --> 00:27:05,673
Hi. You're all right, aren't you?

320
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:07,842
Yes, I'm all right.

321
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:09,634
I came to...

322
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:11,878
I thought...

323
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:14,347
You see...

324
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:17,058
I... I'm going to be
away for a while,

325
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:21,437
and I didn't want you to think
that I'd just gone away.

326
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:23,146
No, I...

327
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:25,107
What I mean is,

328
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:27,692
I'd hate to have you feel that...

329
00:27:27,693 --> 00:27:31,696
That it wasn't important
to me. About...

330
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:33,439
About us.

331
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:36,825
Uh, I don't exactly
know how to say it.

332
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:40,445
You've said it very nicely,
dear, thank you.

333
00:27:41,163 --> 00:27:43,656
No, I don't mean...

334
00:27:43,665 --> 00:27:46,876
- You mustn't feel...
- Will you be gone long?

335
00:27:46,877 --> 00:27:48,460
No.

336
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,045
Only a few days.
There's gonna be a show above...

337
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,172
Up above Plava.
Nothing much, I guess.

338
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,175
A show? You'll be careful, won't you?

339
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:58,544
I won't get hit.

340
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,671
Hold this.

341
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,010
Here.

342
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,055
It's a Saint Anthony.

343
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:20,146
They say a Saint Anthony is very
useful to guard you from harm.

344
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:23,566
I'll take good care of him.

345
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,573
I wish I could kiss you.

346
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,345
He is my friend and a good soldier.

347
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:52,266
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

348
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,100
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

349
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,310
I think not.

350
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:57,187
Couldn't we send her
back to the base, Major?

351
00:28:57,188 --> 00:29:01,232
Oh, if you could send her away,
it would simplify everything.

352
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:03,233
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

353
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:05,069
Excellent, my dear Major!
Magnificent!

354
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,730
No wonder the English
are first in diplomacy.

355
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:15,028
Er, what did you say her name was?

356
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:25,837
We won't get anything else
to eat once the attack starts.

357
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,130
This is all they've given me.

358
00:29:28,131 --> 00:29:30,132
Starting to eat, Tenente?

359
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:34,010
No, we'll all eat together.
Come on, sit down to it.

360
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:41,801
- Thank you.
- Here, you cut this.

361
00:29:51,777 --> 00:29:53,894
Here, take some cheese, it is good.

362
00:29:56,114 --> 00:29:59,191
Wash it down with wine, Tenente.

363
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:01,368
Who goes to the attack?

364
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,334
Bersaglieri.

365
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,846
If nobody would attack,
the war would be over.

366
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,275
That was a big one.

367
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:41,403
- Four hundred twenty?
- No, 305.

368
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:45,564
- Sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.

369
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:06,758
Are you badly hit, Tenente?

370
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,010
Anybody hurt?

371
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,337
My leg.

372
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:15,716
Hold my neck, Tenente.

373
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:20,187
You were right, Tenente.
It was a Skoda gun.

374
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,096
Easy, watch out!

375
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,191
Lacerations of the scalp

376
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:27,609
and possible fracture of the skull.

377
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,780
Multiple superficial wounds
of the left and right thigh,

378
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:34,699
left and right knee, and right foot.

379
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,036
Profound wounds of right knee
and foot incurred in line of duty.

380
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:41,530
Anti-tetanus, please.

381
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:55,050
- Come on, lift him up a little more.
- All right.

382
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:57,085
Carefully!

383
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,639
Hurry, hurry!

384
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:15,059
How do you feel, baby?

385
00:32:15,694 --> 00:32:18,112
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?

386
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:20,239
Bonello telephoned me.

387
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,732
The Major gave me permission to come.

388
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:26,870
No one shall hurt you, baby.
I won't let them.

389
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:29,205
No butcher is going to
touch my war brother.

390
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:32,375
Only Rinaldi can take
you and never hurt you.

391
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:35,543
You must forgive me, baby,
for talking so much, but I am...

392
00:32:35,544 --> 00:32:38,921
I'm very moved to see
you badly wounded.

393
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,548
How did it happen?

394
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:42,383
I will see you are
decorated for bravery.

395
00:32:42,384 --> 00:32:44,218
Perhaps we can get you
the medaglia d'argento,

396
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,887
but surely the bronze one.
Did you carry somebody on your back?

397
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:49,931
I didn't carry anybody.
I couldn't move.

398
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:53,393
Surely there was something heroic.
Tell me what you did.

399
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:56,345
I was blown up eating cheese.

400
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:01,483
Don't worry, baby. I will fix you
so that you are as good as new.

401
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:05,945
You will see. Every day, I learn
to do things smoother, quicker.

402
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:09,482
Soon, very soon,
you will be walking again.

403
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,450
I brought a present for you.

404
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:15,370
You will find it under your
blanket, next to your heart.

405
00:33:15,371 --> 00:33:18,581
It is a bottle of brandy, baby.
Very good brandy.

406
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:22,418
The infantry captured it from
the Austrians on San Gabriele.

407
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,336
I have another surprise for you.

408
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,212
Take a deep breath.

409
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,674
Where do you think
you will go from here?

410
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:33,469
To the Italian hospital where they have
the male nurses with the beards? No.

411
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,181
I will arrange everything with
my friend, the British Major.

412
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:41,210
You will go to Milan. To the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

413
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,687
That makes you happy, huh?

414
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,897
Think of Rinaldi,
left all alone with the war.

415
00:33:46,898 --> 00:33:50,401
No one to make fun of.
No one to lend him money.

416
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,152
While you...

417
00:33:52,153 --> 00:33:55,863
While you are in Milan with
the beautiful Miss Barkley.

418
00:33:55,864 --> 00:34:00,359
Making love in Milan to
the chaste Miss Barkley.

419
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,797
Look out for the step.

420
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,700
Why do you stop?

421
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:50,120
I am the superintendent. May I
have your medical papers, please?

422
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,948
They're in my coat.
In the buttoned-down pocket.

423
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:57,042
Take him up those stairs,
down the corridor.

424
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:01,079
His room is the one at the end.
You show them, Giulio.

425
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:03,256
Who are you?

426
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:05,716
I am the porter, Signor Tenente.

427
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:08,043
Come, follow me.

428
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:20,729
Now, Signor Tenente,
we must lift you off the bed.

429
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:25,141
- All right. But keep my legs straight.
- Si, Signor Tenente.

430
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:29,154
Anything more, Signor Tenente?

431
00:35:29,155 --> 00:35:32,239
- Get me some brandy.
- No, it's not allowed, Signor Tenente.

432
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,575
Wasn't I wounded,
fighting for the glory of Italy?

433
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:39,529
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- As you wish.

434
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:46,710
- So it's you.
- Ferguson.

435
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,129
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.

436
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,588
I believe that's why you got wounded.

437
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,382
- Where is she?
- You ought to be still.

438
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,134
Here's your chart.
I must take your temperature.

439
00:35:55,135 --> 00:35:57,795
Does she know I'm here?

440
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,506
Under the arm, please.

441
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:11,223
- Hello, darling.
- Catherine.

442
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:13,692
You're lovely.

443
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:16,320
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely.

444
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:17,946
Oh, my poor darling.
It's your leg, isn't it?

445
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:20,857
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw.
- Oh...

446
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,537
I have to go now,
darling, I can't stay.

447
00:36:26,538 --> 00:36:27,621
- You'll come back?
- Later.

448
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,664
- But we have to be awfully careful.
- You've got to come back.

449
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,249
I will, when I can.

450
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,701
- Tonight?
- I'll try.

451
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:36,745
Somebody's coming.

452
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:38,664
Tonight.

453
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:46,962
I'll take that thermometer now.

454
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,884
Good gracious!

455
00:36:52,102 --> 00:36:54,394
Fetch the doctor.

456
00:36:54,395 --> 00:36:57,355
It's a miracle you're not
delirious with such a fever.

457
00:36:57,356 --> 00:37:00,975
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet, please.

458
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:03,877
It's not what you think.

459
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,508
I have brought you
a few little things.

460
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:32,552
And this is mosquito netting,
and this is a bottle of vermouth.

461
00:37:32,553 --> 00:37:35,013
You like vermouth, huh?

462
00:37:35,014 --> 00:37:38,099
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you, Father.

463
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,225
It's very good of you to come.

464
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:42,185
Oh, but I mustn't stay long.
They warned me not to tire you.

465
00:37:42,186 --> 00:37:44,146
You seem very tired yourself.

466
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:46,523
I am tired, but I
have no right to be.

467
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:49,442
- You have the war disgust.
- No.

468
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,444
But I hate the war.

469
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:54,155
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it.

470
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:55,697
You do not see it.

471
00:37:55,698 --> 00:37:58,158
Oh, you must forgive me.
I know you are wounded.

472
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,493
That was an accident.

473
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,619
Still, even wounded,
you do not see it.

474
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,582
I can tell. I do not see it myself,
but I feel it a little.

475
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:09,034
Come in, Cat.

476
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:12,962
Don't go yet, Father.
It's still early.

477
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:16,215
You are sure? With the operation
in the morning, he should rest.

478
00:38:16,216 --> 00:38:17,550
Oh, he's strong.

479
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:20,219
He has such a lovely temperature.
It is always normal.

480
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,054
I'm very proud of his temperature.

481
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:24,514
Maybe all our children will
have fine temperatures, too.

482
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:28,301
Our children will probably
have beastly temperatures.

483
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:31,729
Don't mind us, Father. We're in love.

484
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,224
I know. I could see it in your faces.

485
00:38:35,942 --> 00:38:38,977
You approve, don't you, Father?

486
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:41,897
You spoke of children.

487
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:49,111
This, too, is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in God's grace.

488
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,239
Is it not so?

489
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,686
And you?

490
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,574
I hadn't thought about
it like that, but...

491
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,127
Yes, I suppose so.

492
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:29,238
Father, are you...

493
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,190
Is that the marriage service?

494
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:51,340
Of course you realise, Father,

495
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:55,001
that army regulations
prevent us from marrying?

496
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:58,171
They'd send Catherine home.

497
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,985
Poor Cat. Such a crazy marriage.

498
00:40:13,986 --> 00:40:16,604
At least I'm in white.

499
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,156
No orange blossoms.

500
00:40:19,157 --> 00:40:21,524
I can smell them.

501
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:23,868
No organ music.

502
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,578
I can hear it plainly.

503
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:43,377
It was a foolish notion, perhaps.

504
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,388
I have not the right to
say you are married.

505
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:49,599
Yet, it has made me happy to do this.

506
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,560
For now, from my heart, I can
say I bless you in His name.

507
00:40:52,561 --> 00:40:54,970
Thank you, Father.

508
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,106
Goodbye and be happy, both of you.

509
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,517
Thank you, Father.

510
00:41:00,944 --> 00:41:04,153
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.

511
00:41:04,154 --> 00:41:08,449
And get well soon. I will come
again the next time I am in Milan.

512
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,402
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye.

513
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,200
Is Miss Barkley here?

514
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:21,494
Uh-uh.

515
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:24,830
No. No!

516
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:37,725
Shut the door.

517
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:40,510
- I can't.
- Please, darling.

518
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:51,278
We mustn't.
Your operation's in the morning.

519
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:53,104
It's our wedding night.

520
00:41:53,573 --> 00:41:55,606
Oh, darling.

521
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:59,243
You'll have to take your oil.

522
00:41:59,244 --> 00:42:00,661
Castor oil? No.

523
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,079
You'll take it from me.

524
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,623
- I'll take anything from you...
- Darling.

525
00:42:04,624 --> 00:42:06,650
...if you stay.

526
00:42:07,877 --> 00:42:10,369
Oh, darling, darling.

527
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:11,837
I want what you want.

528
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:14,298
There isn't any "me" any more,
just what you want.

529
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,542
You're sweet.

530
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,431
Don't I make a lovely wife?

531
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:27,343
Such a lovely wife.

532
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:31,522
Feel our hearts beat.

533
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:34,607
No wonder my heart beats.

534
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:37,017
I'm mad about you.

535
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:51,883
That's the opera I made
my debut in at La Scala.

536
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:54,510
- They threw benches at him.
- That's a lie!

537
00:43:54,511 --> 00:43:56,929
Yes, they did. I threw
six benches myself.

538
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,339
That's not funny.

539
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:05,854
Oh, now he is offended.

540
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:09,148
He'll get over it. That's his sore spot.
We always tease him.

541
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,858
You don't care whom you hurt.

542
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,610
Now, don't you get mad, too.

543
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:15,195
Catherine and I were thinking
of asking you to our wedding.

544
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:16,488
Weren't we, Cat?

545
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,615
- You'll never get married.
- We will!

546
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:21,200
No, you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.

547
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,701
- Oh, we never fight.
- You've time yet.

548
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,078
We won't fight ever.

549
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,662
You'll die, then.

550
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,907
Fight or die. That's what people do.

551
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,993
- They don't marry.
- Why, Fergy!

552
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,455
I'm not crying.

553
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,508
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.

554
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:41,135
Watch out you don't
get her in trouble.

555
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,887
- I won't get her into trouble.
- You better not.

556
00:44:43,888 --> 00:44:46,089
Or I'll kill you.

557
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:48,307
Why, Fergy...

558
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:50,643
What is the matter with her?

559
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,102
She doesn't like me, that's all.

560
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:55,430
Oh, no. She just likes me more.

561
00:45:01,862 --> 00:45:04,155
Are you on night duty tonight?

562
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:06,573
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.

563
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:08,742
You wait and see.

564
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:14,079
Darling, how many other
girls have you ever loved?

565
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,205
None.

566
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:16,916
How many, really?

567
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,783
None.

568
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:21,545
How many have you, um...

569
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:23,296
How do you say it...

570
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,248
Loved?

571
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,050
- None.
- You're lying to me.

572
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,468
- Of course.
- Oh, that's right.

573
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:33,513
You just keep right on lying,
that's what I want you to do.

574
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:35,098
Were they pretty?

575
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,433
I have never been with anyone.

576
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,051
That's right, darling.

577
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:41,437
What were they like?

578
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,397
I don't know anything about it.

579
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:48,109
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.

580
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,070
I don't care if you have, though.
I'm not afraid of them.

581
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:52,863
Only, don't tell me about them.

582
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:54,699
You never told them you
loved them, did you?

583
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,526
- No.
- I knew you wouldn't.

584
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:01,655
- Oh, darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.

585
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:04,740
- Right here on the street?
- Yes.

586
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:19,753
I'll go in first.

587
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:32,314
So...

588
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:36,093
What is this, if I may ask?
What was in it?

589
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:38,320
That's kummel.

590
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:41,405
That's the best kind. It comes in those
bear-shaped bottles from Russia.

591
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:43,441
And these?

592
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:46,285
That's brandy, wine and whisky.

593
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:49,454
And I've been pitying you
for being wounded.

594
00:46:49,455 --> 00:46:51,748
Pity is something that
is wasted on you.

595
00:46:51,749 --> 00:46:52,999
- Thank you.
- If you're so anxious

596
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,501
not to go back to the front,

597
00:46:54,502 --> 00:46:57,044
I should think you'd try
something more intelligent.

598
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:59,296
Not self-inflicted alcoholism!

599
00:46:59,297 --> 00:47:01,507
- What?
- I said, "Alcoholism!"

600
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:06,669
And I also say that I'll see your
convalescent leave is cancelled.

601
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:10,548
You'll go back to the
front tomorrow night.

602
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:34,369
Have I time for a drink
before the train leaves?

603
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,662
- For the front?
- Yes.

604
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:39,156
- About 20 minutes, Signor Capitano.
- Right.

605
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:11,276
It's a fine room, a lovely room.

606
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:12,860
It's all right.

607
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:18,024
The red plush is just the thing.
Those mirrors are very attractive, too.

608
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,367
People who go in for vice seem to
have very good taste about it.

609
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:23,494
Hmm, you're a grand girl.

610
00:48:23,495 --> 00:48:25,821
Oh, darling.

611
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,542
I wish we could do
something really simple.

612
00:48:30,543 --> 00:48:33,670
Everything we do seems
so innocent and right.

613
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:35,589
You're a fine, simple girl.

614
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,300
I am a simple girl.
Nobody but you ever realised it.

615
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:41,677
At first, I thought you
were a crazy girl.

616
00:48:41,678 --> 00:48:43,762
I was a little crazy at first.

617
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:49,517
Was that your train?

618
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:50,852
Maybe.

619
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:52,311
It makes up at Turin.

620
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:55,564
But it stays in the station
here until time to leave.

621
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,434
There's really lots of time.

622
00:49:02,113 --> 00:49:07,567
"But at my back, I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near"

623
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:10,452
I know that poem. It's by Marvell.

624
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:14,406
Oh, it's about a girl who
wouldn't live with a man.

625
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,663
Listen.

626
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:30,303
It's only the rain.

627
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,263
I hate the rain.

628
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:33,514
I like it.

629
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:35,766
I'm afraid of the rain.

630
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,218
- Afraid, why?
- I...

631
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:41,562
- Well, perhaps it's silly.
- What? Tell me.

632
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:44,390
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.

633
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,517
All right.

634
00:49:46,568 --> 00:49:49,945
I'm afraid of the rain because
sometimes I see me dead in it.

635
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,321
No!

636
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,990
And sometimes I see you dead in it.

637
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,827
- That's more likely.
- Oh, now, darling, don't say that.

638
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,241
That is your train.

639
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:08,035
Time's winged chariot.

640
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,176
I'll come with you, hmm?

641
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:19,345
No, please, I don't want you...
Not... Not at the station.

642
00:50:19,346 --> 00:50:21,597
All right, darling.

643
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:22,682
How often will you write?

644
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:24,934
As often as I can.
Do they read your letters?

645
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:26,852
They can't read English
enough to hurt anything.

646
00:50:26,853 --> 00:50:28,728
Well, I'll make them very confusing.

647
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,147
But not too confusing.

648
00:50:30,148 --> 00:50:32,357
Oh, I should have got
you a going-away gift.

649
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:34,693
A whistle to make you
feel better in the dark.

650
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:38,071
Or a sword. I'm sure we could
get a used sword very cheap.

651
00:50:38,072 --> 00:50:39,530
Swords aren't very
useful at the front.

652
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:42,365
Oh, I see, they get in the way of
your legs when you're running.

653
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:46,278
They might be useful at mess, though.

654
00:50:47,746 --> 00:50:51,073
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.

655
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,960
I hate to leave our fine house.

656
00:50:54,961 --> 00:50:56,953
So do I.

657
00:50:58,214 --> 00:51:01,507
We never stay settled very
long in a home, do we?

658
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:03,459
We will.

659
00:51:04,052 --> 00:51:07,922
I'll have a fine home for
you when you come back.

660
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,383
Say, "I'll come back to Catherine."

661
00:51:12,184 --> 00:51:14,302
I'll come back to Catherine.

662
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:23,643
I'll always come back.

663
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:30,324
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt
just a little in the foot.

664
00:51:30,325 --> 00:51:31,783
- Or the lobe of the ear.
- Oh, no, no, no.

665
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:34,077
I want your ears just
the way they are.

666
00:51:34,078 --> 00:51:37,280
Your feet have been hurt already.

667
00:53:42,107 --> 00:53:43,773
I want a ticket to
Switzerland, please.

668
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:46,276
- To where, signora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.

669
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:47,944
That would be Brissago, signora.

670
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,738
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.
- All right.

671
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:51,072
Oh...

672
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:52,531
Oh, Fergy, I was afraid
you wouldn't come.

673
00:53:52,532 --> 00:53:54,367
Would you mind telling
me what this is all about?

674
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:56,159
- I'm going away.
- So I gathered by this,

675
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,703
but where? Why?

676
00:53:57,704 --> 00:54:00,197
To Switzerland, to have a baby.

677
00:54:00,623 --> 00:54:02,365
Oh.

678
00:54:02,958 --> 00:54:04,166
I knew he'd get you in trouble.

679
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,542
Oh, now, it wasn't his
fault, really, Fergy.

680
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,878
What's he going to do about it?

681
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:08,337
He doesn't know it.

682
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,588
You didn't tell him?

683
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:11,047
What would be the good?
It would only worry him.

684
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,716
He'd have to go anyway.

685
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,050
Aren't you going to tell him?

686
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:18,087
Well, not yet. I may write
him from Switzerland.

687
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,473
- You're a fool.
- Here, signora.

688
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:23,433
- On Track 3.
- Thank you.

689
00:54:23,434 --> 00:54:24,893
What's the hurry? Why tonight?

690
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:28,187
I couldn't go back to that hospital.
I couldn't stand it. Not with him gone.

691
00:54:28,188 --> 00:54:29,605
But you'll be all
alone in Switzerland.

692
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:33,058
Don't worry, Fergy,
I'll be all right.

693
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:36,687
You're not afraid of
anything, are you?

694
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:40,114
Only of going back to that hospital.

695
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:41,366
Don't scold me, Fergy.

696
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:47,113
I'll carry it.

697
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,446
"I've always told you
I was a crazy girl.

698
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,823
"I couldn't bear Milan with you away.

699
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,283
"So I've chucked the war and come
to live in this little Swiss town

700
00:55:30,284 --> 00:55:33,536
"as near as possible to the
Italian border and you.

701
00:55:33,537 --> 00:55:37,331
"And, darling, it's an adorable
place and we'll be very happy here.

702
00:55:37,332 --> 00:55:40,034
"I've taken a suite...

703
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,921
"...suite in the best hotel.

704
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:47,381
"And I'm fairly wallowing in luxury.

705
00:55:47,382 --> 00:55:51,134
"The bed is Empire and
fit for an empress.

706
00:55:51,135 --> 00:55:53,971
"There's a maroon velvet
carpet, ankle-deep,

707
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:57,140
"and a bathroom...
Oh, darling, the bathroom!

708
00:55:57,141 --> 00:56:00,718
"It's of black marble
with silver fittings.

709
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:05,347
"I've just dined in state
at my sitting-room window,

710
00:56:05,523 --> 00:56:10,685
"from which there is a divine view of
the lake shimmering in moonlight."

711
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,455
I'm an awful liar, darling.

712
00:56:24,456 --> 00:56:28,792
It's not really a nice place at all.
It's mean, cheap and horrible.

713
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,753
But it doesn't matter where I live,

714
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:35,040
because I don't really live
at all when I'm not with you.

715
00:56:35,674 --> 00:56:37,875
Oh, darling...

716
00:56:39,553 --> 00:56:43,014
What I really wanna
tell you is that...

717
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:47,601
That I shall lie awake in the dark
and cry, because you're not here.

718
00:56:47,602 --> 00:56:50,386
I'm lonely and frightened.

719
00:56:50,562 --> 00:56:52,847
And I love you.

720
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,035
- Hurry, baby.
- Why?

721
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:09,036
- Time to go.
- Go where?

722
00:57:09,037 --> 00:57:10,746
But I told you before,
to the Villa Rossa.

723
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:13,498
- New girls. Everybody's going.
- Not me.

724
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:17,544
But you must. It will be a fine party.
And, besides, I said you would go.

725
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:20,212
I can't. I've got to write a letter.

726
00:57:20,213 --> 00:57:22,381
Oh, to that little...

727
00:57:22,382 --> 00:57:25,216
Every day, more letters.
You might as well be married.

728
00:57:25,217 --> 00:57:26,968
That's my business.

729
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:30,846
Oh, baby. How you
ever come back to me?

730
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:33,390
Serious like a
shopkeeper with a liver.

731
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:35,475
Where is my war brother who
used to get drunk with me

732
00:57:35,476 --> 00:57:38,478
and go to the Villa
Rossa every night?

733
00:57:38,479 --> 00:57:40,179
Leave me alone, will you?

734
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,183
Why? Isn't she just a girl?

735
00:57:44,693 --> 00:57:46,694
Keep her out of this.

736
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:49,613
Sacred subject. Believe me, baby,

737
00:57:49,614 --> 00:57:53,191
sacred subjects are not
good for soldiers.

738
00:57:53,884 --> 00:57:57,286
Why don't you be like me?
All fire and smoke.

739
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,121
And nothing inside.

740
00:57:59,622 --> 00:58:01,957
- Come on, baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.

741
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,417
Of course I am drunk!

742
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:05,711
You come with me and
you will be drunk, too.

743
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:07,420
Come on, baby.

744
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:11,991
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come.
There is no more ink.

745
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,160
Get your hands off me and get out!

746
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:21,641
Poor baby.

747
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:24,768
Tomorrow I will get you drunk
and I will take out your liver

748
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,937
and I will put you in
a good Italian liver

749
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:29,314
and make a man of you again.

750
00:58:29,315 --> 00:58:31,391
Ciao, baby.

751
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,285
You're going out, Signor Capitano?

752
00:58:44,286 --> 00:58:47,788
- Yes, why?
- The mail just came, Signor Capitano.

753
00:58:47,789 --> 00:58:50,916
- You censor it.
- Signor capitano...

754
00:58:50,917 --> 00:58:53,618
The officers' mail, too?

755
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:58,164
Very well.

756
00:59:09,517 --> 00:59:11,351
Aren't you gonna open them,
Signor Capitano?

757
00:59:11,352 --> 00:59:12,560
No!

758
00:59:12,561 --> 00:59:14,846
I'm in a hurry.

759
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:34,329
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Signor Capitano.

760
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:37,582
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

761
00:59:37,583 --> 00:59:40,034
Yes, Signor capitano.

762
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:04,730
And today my letters came back.
Every one I'd ever written to her.

763
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:05,856
Came back?

764
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:08,484
Just marked "Return to sender.
Person unknown."

765
01:00:08,485 --> 01:00:10,402
Well, that's very strange.

766
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:12,529
Thirty-two letters.
She never got one.

767
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,824
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.
- No.

768
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:18,076
She'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

769
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:21,745
- Have you tried to...
- I can't get any information at all.

770
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:25,165
- I've got to go and find her myself.
- How can you?

771
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,708
I'm going to Milan. I'll find her.

772
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,710
But aren't all leaves
of absence forbidden

773
01:00:28,711 --> 01:00:30,628
since that battle in the north began?

774
01:00:30,629 --> 01:00:34,081
- I'm going anyway.
- No, that's desertion.

775
01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:36,883
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.

776
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:40,220
- You mustn't do this, Frederico.
- Yes, I must.

777
01:00:40,221 --> 01:00:43,056
That's what I wanted
to tell you, Padre.

778
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:44,932
What does this war
mean to me any more?

779
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,726
What does anything mean,
but finding her?

780
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:50,304
- But Frederico, consider the...
- I can depend on you, Padre?

781
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,235
Say goodbye to Rinaldi
and the others for me.

782
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,113
- When are you leaving?
- Now. While they are at dinner.

783
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,106
And by morning, when they miss me,
I'll be halfway to Milan.

784
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:05,868
If they ask me, what will I say? I...

785
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:08,078
Anything you like.

786
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,579
Goodbye, Padre.

787
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,413
Goodbye, Frederico.

788
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:14,658
May the Lord bless and preserve you.

789
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,785
What are you carabinieri
doing in the yards?

790
01:07:29,786 --> 01:07:32,079
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?

791
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,247
Send them back to fight invaders.

792
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:37,125
Every foot of Italian
soil must be regained.

793
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:38,835
Suppose they don't want to go back?

794
01:07:38,836 --> 01:07:41,287
Then we shoot them.

795
01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,603
- Catherine.
- Who's that?

796
01:07:59,604 --> 01:08:02,221
Shh! Where's Catherine?

797
01:08:02,773 --> 01:08:06,067
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Catherine?

798
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:07,235
I know.

799
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:09,695
You've run away. You're a deserter.

800
01:08:09,696 --> 01:08:13,065
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't. She's gone.

801
01:08:13,282 --> 01:08:16,443
- Gone? Where?
- And you'd better get out.

802
01:08:18,787 --> 01:08:21,122
- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here,

803
01:08:21,123 --> 01:08:23,957
I'll scream and bring the
whole hospital down on you.

804
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,710
- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!

805
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,461
- Tell me where she is!
- Go ahead, choke me,

806
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:30,713
but I won't tell you.
You've done her enough harm.

807
01:08:30,714 --> 01:08:33,257
- What do you mean?
- I said you'd get her into trouble.

808
01:08:33,258 --> 01:08:36,176
I hate you. Hate, you understand?
I won't tell you anything.

809
01:08:36,177 --> 01:08:37,886
Shh!

810
01:08:37,887 --> 01:08:40,514
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you!

811
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,390
Pay you back for what
you've done to her.

812
01:08:42,391 --> 01:08:45,009
Making her have a baby.

813
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:48,396
- Baby?
- I warned you, but you didn't care.

814
01:08:48,397 --> 01:08:49,813
Not about her.

815
01:08:49,814 --> 01:08:52,315
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?

816
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:54,484
Where? Oh, for pity's sake,
tell me! Fergy!

817
01:08:54,485 --> 01:08:56,569
No, no! No!

818
01:08:58,864 --> 01:09:00,606
No!

819
01:09:00,657 --> 01:09:03,325
- We're coming, too!
- Be careful, girls.

820
01:09:03,326 --> 01:09:05,068
Where is he?

821
01:09:06,871 --> 01:09:12,458
And get me some clothes. A full outfit.
I can't go around in this uniform.

822
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:15,044
As long as I don't get
mixed up in it myself.

823
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:17,171
You won't. I just want
you to get some things,

824
01:09:17,172 --> 01:09:19,298
and put an advertisement
in the newspaper for me.

825
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:22,751
I really oughtn't to,
if I had any sense.

826
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:27,305
I know I shall have awful gas pains
in the morning as a result of this.

827
01:09:27,306 --> 01:09:28,847
Just say...

828
01:09:28,848 --> 01:09:32,384
"Catherine, where are you?

829
01:09:33,186 --> 01:09:35,562
"I am free at last.

830
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:39,140
"Meet me at the Palace
Hotel, Stresa."

831
01:09:39,857 --> 01:09:42,184
Signed "Frederic."

832
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:15,096
The Major made an obituary speech
in your memory and the Priest,

833
01:10:15,097 --> 01:10:18,057
- he wanted to say mass for your soul.
- But what...

834
01:10:18,058 --> 01:10:20,559
Vermouth. One for you?
Uh, two vermouth.

835
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,228
You see, we all thought
you were dead.

836
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:25,939
It never occurred to us that you
might have be shell-shocked,

837
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:28,066
wandered away, lost your memory.

838
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:30,067
How did you find me?

839
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:33,437
I saw your advertisement
in the paper.

840
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:35,614
But as soon as we knew,
we arranged everything.

841
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:38,575
Rinaldi will work on you one
of his miraculous cures.

842
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:40,284
You will go back a hero.

843
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:41,577
I'm not going back.

844
01:10:41,578 --> 01:10:45,205
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.

845
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:46,949
No.

846
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:49,626
I'm through with the war.
Get that straight.

847
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,253
But you cannot do that!

848
01:10:51,254 --> 01:10:53,129
You cannot just stop and say,
"I'm through with the war."

849
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:55,256
- They will not let you do that.
- Two vermouth.

850
01:10:55,257 --> 01:10:56,999
Hmm.

851
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:05,098
Can I speak to you a moment, sir?

852
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:07,767
- It's all right, Harry, he's my friend.
- But I, uh...

853
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:11,771
He keeps telling me that it's dangerous
for me to stay here any longer.

854
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:16,107
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabinieri.

855
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:20,486
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow, who knows? But soon.

856
01:11:20,487 --> 01:11:23,522
My boat is still ready, sir.

857
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,609
Thank you, Harry.

858
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:29,952
If they arrest you,
no one can save you.

859
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,954
- I know that.
- They will shoot you.

860
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,289
Look...

861
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:37,118
Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

862
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:40,996
I've got to wait here until
I can find Catherine.

863
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:44,382
And how do you expect to do that?

864
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,592
I've got some people looking for her.

865
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:51,671
- If that is more important than...
- She's going to have a baby.

866
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:53,923
My baby.

867
01:11:56,894 --> 01:11:58,677
So...

868
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:02,139
And that means everything to you.

869
01:12:02,816 --> 01:12:04,858
Yes, it would.

870
01:12:04,859 --> 01:12:09,354
It means that I've got to find
her and get her out of Italy.

871
01:12:09,363 --> 01:12:13,858
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?

872
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:15,952
She is in Switzerland.

873
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:17,619
Where?

874
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:20,155
- Brissago.
- Brissago?

875
01:12:20,873 --> 01:12:22,782
Harry!

876
01:12:45,519 --> 01:12:47,354
Will you do one for me, too?

877
01:12:47,355 --> 01:12:50,347
Yes, madam. Step around here.

878
01:12:52,359 --> 01:12:53,860
No.

879
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:56,437
Just the head, please.

880
01:13:30,392 --> 01:13:32,018
Isn't there any mail for me, yet?

881
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:33,644
Ah, madam!

882
01:13:33,645 --> 01:13:36,104
Yes, yes. Today there are letters.

883
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:38,732
- Many letters.
- Many? Oh!

884
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:39,941
- Twenty, madam.
- Twenty!

885
01:13:39,942 --> 01:13:43,228
Well, that was worth waiting for...

886
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:47,773
Oh...

887
01:14:19,768 --> 01:14:22,102
It is up the lake and across.

888
01:14:22,103 --> 01:14:24,605
- About 35 kilometres.
- I'll make it.

889
01:14:24,606 --> 01:14:26,398
At the frontier,
there will be sentries.

890
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,192
- I know.
- And you will have to watch out

891
01:14:28,193 --> 01:14:29,651
- for patrol boats.
- I will.

892
01:14:29,652 --> 01:14:33,312
- If it blows too hard, you...
- I won't drown.

893
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:37,816
Have you enough money? Here.

894
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:41,078
Won't you need it?

895
01:14:41,079 --> 01:14:43,830
There must be a Villa
Rossa in Pordenone.

896
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:46,624
Always the same girls until
they become like old friends.

897
01:14:46,625 --> 01:14:50,294
Like war comrades.
Take it, baby, please. Please.

898
01:14:50,295 --> 01:14:52,088
You're a good egg, Rinin.

899
01:14:52,089 --> 01:14:56,667
No, I am not a good egg. I am a fool.

900
01:14:56,968 --> 01:15:00,878
But if I had understood
how you felt about her...

901
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:03,756
Good luck, baby.

902
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,687
Ciao, baby.

903
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:32,155
- Shall I get a new cylinder, Doctor?
- It is a new cylinder.

904
01:15:33,124 --> 01:15:37,535
Oh, I wanted so to have this
baby and not make any trouble.

905
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:40,705
And now I'm all done.

906
01:15:41,548 --> 01:15:44,124
All gone to pieces.

907
01:16:04,902 --> 01:16:06,944
She is losing strength fast, Doctor.

908
01:16:06,945 --> 01:16:09,896
There's no use. I'll have to operate.

909
01:16:11,949 --> 01:16:14,400
That was lovely...

910
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:19,739
Frederic, darling.

911
01:16:23,877 --> 01:16:26,745
You mustn't worry, darling.

912
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:29,998
I'm not going to die now.

913
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:36,128
I got past the place
where I was going to die.

914
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:40,640
Aren't you glad?

915
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:42,309
Of course you are not going to die.

916
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,136
You mustn't think about it.

917
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,697
- It's a caesarean.
- We're lucky to be on time.

918
01:17:26,764 --> 01:17:28,099
Is she going to be all right?

919
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,683
- Are you the husband?
- Yes.

920
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:30,934
She kept calling for you all night.

921
01:17:30,935 --> 01:17:32,769
It would have been better
if you'd been here.

922
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,063
I'm sorry. Is she in danger?

923
01:17:35,064 --> 01:17:37,607
- She's very weak.
- You don't suppose I could see her now?

924
01:17:37,608 --> 01:17:40,684
- Later, later.
- It won't be long.

925
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:22,179
She can't die.

926
01:18:24,357 --> 01:18:26,557
Did you call?

927
01:18:29,653 --> 01:18:32,938
No, I didn't say anything.

928
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:54,874
Not yet.

929
01:18:56,968 --> 01:18:59,136
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.

930
01:18:59,137 --> 01:19:00,179
The baby?

931
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:02,972
A boy, but he was dead before
she ever came in here.

932
01:19:02,973 --> 01:19:05,308
Oh... But she'll be all right?

933
01:19:05,309 --> 01:19:08,469
That's not in my hands any longer.

934
01:19:10,188 --> 01:19:13,523
Better go across the street and
get yourself some breakfast.

935
01:19:13,524 --> 01:19:15,317
You look as if you need it.

936
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:18,895
It will be some time
before she can see you.

937
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:40,247
There's nothing there, dog.

938
01:20:10,366 --> 01:20:13,158
You've had children?
What was it like?

939
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:15,945
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

940
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:22,408
Nothing. Some coffee,
please, and a brioche.

941
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:34,594
It's in the papers. Italy has won!

942
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:36,137
Thank God it's over.

943
01:20:36,138 --> 01:20:38,430
This is the beginning of the end.

944
01:20:38,431 --> 01:20:41,767
But it will be a long time
before they can rebuild

945
01:20:41,768 --> 01:20:43,560
what's been destroyed.

946
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:46,772
"In the early morning
hours of November 4th,

947
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:51,234
"the Austro-Hungarian supreme
command accepted by radiogram

948
01:20:51,235 --> 01:20:55,770
"the armistice conditions laid
down by the General Badoglio."

949
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:59,274
Don't let her die.

950
01:20:59,950 --> 01:21:03,236
Oh, God, please don't let her die.

951
01:21:03,954 --> 01:21:07,623
I'll do anything for you
if you don't let her die.

952
01:21:07,624 --> 01:21:09,667
You took the baby...

953
01:21:09,668 --> 01:21:13,328
That was all right.
But don't let her die.

954
01:21:13,629 --> 01:21:15,129
Please.

955
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:19,959
Please, dear God, don't let her die.

956
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:49,026
Her husband's out there.

957
01:21:49,493 --> 01:21:51,819
Might as well let him in.

958
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,992
I knew he was coming.

959
01:21:58,543 --> 01:22:01,912
When I went under,
I knew he was here.

960
01:22:05,382 --> 01:22:07,925
You won't tell him, will you?

961
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:10,470
Tell him what?

962
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:12,880
That I'm going to die.

963
01:22:15,141 --> 01:22:19,052
- No, we won't tell him.
- Thank you.

964
01:22:21,438 --> 01:22:23,431
Doctor...

965
01:22:24,608 --> 01:22:26,725
Have I long?

966
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,117
Don't you see?

967
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:38,235
I have to know.

968
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:40,946
Not long.

969
01:22:46,918 --> 01:22:49,244
Let him come in.

970
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,872
No, wait.

971
01:22:52,798 --> 01:22:54,716
Could I...

972
01:22:54,717 --> 01:22:57,544
Could I have my bag, first?

973
01:23:06,895 --> 01:23:09,679
Oh! Such a mess.

974
01:23:14,567 --> 01:23:17,519
He never liked me to be pale.

975
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:29,780
You can go in now.

976
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,461
- Catherine.
- Darling.

977
01:23:53,643 --> 01:23:56,553
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.

978
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:59,389
Did you worry about me?

979
01:23:59,857 --> 01:24:02,943
I came as soon as I
found where you were.

980
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,694
Poor darling.

981
01:24:04,695 --> 01:24:07,146
Let me look at you.

982
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:09,031
Ah...

983
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:12,151
Tut-tut. You're wet and tired.

984
01:24:12,493 --> 01:24:15,319
Sit down, darling. Here...

985
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:25,703
You're going to be
all right, Catherine.

986
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,636
Do you want me to do anything, Cat?

987
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:37,506
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

988
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:40,466
Just talk to me.

989
01:24:40,726 --> 01:24:43,311
Tell me you haven't
stopped loving me.

990
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:46,055
You know I couldn't stop.

991
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:48,983
I like to hear you say it, though.

992
01:24:48,984 --> 01:24:51,235
I'll never stop loving you.

993
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:53,144
Never?

994
01:24:53,404 --> 01:24:55,238
Not even

995
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,440
if I died?

996
01:24:59,118 --> 01:25:01,026
Never.

997
01:25:04,288 --> 01:25:06,998
You'd never do our things
with any other girl,

998
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:09,792
or say the same things, would you?

999
01:25:09,793 --> 01:25:11,418
Never.

1000
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:14,755
I want you to have
other girls, though.

1001
01:25:14,756 --> 01:25:17,048
I don't want them.

1002
01:25:17,049 --> 01:25:19,542
That's right, dear.

1003
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:26,140
Try...

1004
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:28,300
Try to sleep, Cat.

1005
01:25:33,188 --> 01:25:36,807
When I get well, we'll...

1006
01:25:37,234 --> 01:25:40,819
We'll take a little house
in the mountains.

1007
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:44,647
We always planned a house
of our own, remember?

1008
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,525
I'll get you a fine house.

1009
01:25:48,035 --> 01:25:51,445
We'll live in it until
the war is over.

1010
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:56,825
Then you'll go back to America
and be a splendid architect.

1011
01:25:57,877 --> 01:26:01,579
We'll be married all
over again. In a church.

1012
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:04,081
In a church.

1013
01:26:06,342 --> 01:26:08,302
Oh, darling!

1014
01:26:08,303 --> 01:26:10,720
I don't wanna die.

1015
01:26:10,721 --> 01:26:12,764
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!

1016
01:26:12,765 --> 01:26:16,225
Take me in your arms, hold me tight.

1017
01:26:16,226 --> 01:26:18,727
- Don't let me go.
- Catherine.

1018
01:26:18,728 --> 01:26:21,063
It's dark out there, and lonely.

1019
01:26:21,064 --> 01:26:25,392
I don't wanna leave you any more.
I've been alone so much.

1020
01:26:27,027 --> 01:26:31,105
You... You can't die.
You're too brave to die.

1021
01:26:36,202 --> 01:26:39,487
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

1022
01:26:39,996 --> 01:26:44,083
Yes. I am a brave girl.

1023
01:26:44,084 --> 01:26:47,286
Whatever happens, do not be afraid.

1024
01:26:47,462 --> 01:26:49,754
I'll not be afraid.

1025
01:26:49,755 --> 01:26:54,042
We've never been apart.
Really. Not since we met.

1026
01:26:54,468 --> 01:26:56,427
Not since we met.

1027
01:26:56,428 --> 01:26:58,596
And never can be.

1028
01:26:58,597 --> 01:27:02,299
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.

1029
01:27:02,516 --> 01:27:04,601
Say it, Cat.

1030
01:27:04,602 --> 01:27:07,303
In life and in death,

1031
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:10,806
we'll never be parted.

1032
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:14,643
You do believe that, don't you, Cat?

1033
01:27:16,362 --> 01:27:18,563
I believe it.

1034
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:22,274
And I'm not afraid.

1035
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:13,026
Peace...

1036
01:28:13,628 --> 01:28:16,330
Peace...
