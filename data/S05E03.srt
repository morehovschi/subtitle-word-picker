1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Captain Swing, calling
from the occupied Six Counties.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,080
This Michael, your kin,

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:09,823
making deals with the very
men who want you dead.

4
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:11,575
What happened on that ship?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,006
Said the men from Glasgow
were called Billy Boys.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,999
Protestant razor gang.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,399
They run every man east of Glasgow.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,879
We have a mutual acquaintance.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,159
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,919
I'm Jimmy.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,599
I need Mr Shelby to understand that
his best is not good enough.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,439
Your body will be the lesson.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,639
Tommy, what are you talking about?

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,479
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,799
My chair. My throne.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,720
People think that I'm going to
fall, they start to circle.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,940
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,269
Black cat dreams are never wrong.

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,600
They crucified my son...

20
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,360
...for you.

21
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,340
Good morning, sisters.

22
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:26,420
Let us pray.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Our Father, who art in heaven...

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,640
...but deliver us from evil...

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,916
...for thine is the kingdom,

26
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:06,308
the power and the glory,
for ever and ever...

27
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,400
...Amen.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,159
You wanted to speak to us, Mr Shelby?

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,439
Yeah.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,439
- All of us?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,279
At 6.30 in the morning?

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes.

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
- We don't smoke in here.
- Well, I fucking do.

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,119
Nor do we use language.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,439
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.

36
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,986
Yet you do.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
You fucking do.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,359
May I ask what this meeting is about?

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,639
The Grace Shelby Foundation is the
biggest single source of funding

40
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,279
for this charitable institution,

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,700
devoted to the care of the orphaned
girls of south Birmingham, yeah?

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,239
For which we give thanks.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,340
Uh-huh.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,599
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,020
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,740
Whose report?

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
The testimony of children.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,260
Who have they spoken to?

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,079
- You'd have them only speak to God.
- God be their witness.

50
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,399
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,799
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.

52
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,199
We are much, much closer at hand
than God.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,119
And we have heard terrible things.

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,439
We have, in this place,
children of the worst sort.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,119
They lie as easily as breathe.

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
You had a child half black.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,940
You made her wash with a different soap.

58
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,998
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

59
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:56,660
Our sins...

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,719
Our sins against the beating of children

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,759
with bricks and hoses.

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,680
Our sins.

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,660
Our sins...

64
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,313
...against the black child
who hanged herself

65
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,180
for fear of your temper.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,920
- I do not see how...
- You do not see!

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,640
Now put 'em on.

68
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,839
Put 'em on your face,

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,180
or it'll be your eyes that are broken.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,239
Please don't imagine that I won't
use this minute to do it,

71
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,599
or that I am afraid of your prayers

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,100
or your crosses.

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,720
You see the world broken.

74
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,500
Like those beaten children will.

75
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,160
Now look at me.

76
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,060
Look at me.

77
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,540
Look at me!

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,060
Funding withdrawn.

79
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,919
All children to be taken
into our own institutions.

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,799
You have no say in where the children...

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,519
If I come for you,

82
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,679
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,759
I will wear high heels
so you can hear my approach

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,860
on the cobblestones,
and have time to repent.

85
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,246
You listen for my footsteps.

86
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,784

87
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,242
Happy birthday, Pol.

88
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:28,482
They grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.

89
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,922
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

90
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:37,241
The train to London leaves in an hour.

91
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:40,161
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.

92
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:43,420
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

93
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:49,921
A week ago, one of our most trusted
men was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

94
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,721
The man we're going to speak to in London

95
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:53,961
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

96
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,601
So cancel your appointments,

97
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,641
and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.

98
00:06:57,642 --> 00:06:59,700
That's what women do.

99
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,181
And clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in my car, eh?

100
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:09,449
Michael, they will give it and give
it until your case is proven,

101
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,601
and then they'll take it.

102
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:13,536
From you, but mainly from me.

103
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:17,561
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

104
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,001
You tell him there is a strategy in place

105
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:22,041
to avenge the death of his son,

106
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,001
so not to do anything rash.

107
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:27,001
And take with you the heartfelt
condolences of the whole family.

108
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,660
Why me?

109
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:33,761
Because Aberama Gold is in love with
you. He even got a haircut.

110
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,841
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

111
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,641
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

112
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:42,241
45 years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

113
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:43,921
- Yeah!
- To Polly!

114
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,521
Polly Gray, hmm?

115
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:46,561
Polly.

116
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,401
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?

117
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:52,681
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

118
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:57,380
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

119
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:01,361
Michael, turn the Bentley around,
you've a train to catch.

120
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:06,442
And don't forget to wipe that shit
off your shoes, eh?

121
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,921
Just start up the car and drive.

122
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:34,121
So, what's the strategy?

123
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,481
You can smile.

124
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,042
You... don't smile.

125
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,642
Nice.

126
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,321
Very nice, Tom.

127
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,940
Hmm.

128
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:52,761
Although, I must say, I thought your
office would be bigger than this.

129
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:54,081
It will be.

130
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:56,094
Michael, you sit.

131
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,780
Arthur, you stand by the window.

132
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:09,961
So, who are we meeting?

133
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:12,481
The man we're about to meet

134
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:14,561
is the Minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

135
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:18,681
He's also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

136
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:22,660
and Cabinet adviser to the Prime
Minister of Great Britain.

137
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:26,722
You've both met bad men before.

138
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:31,460
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

139
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:38,802
Yep. Send him in.

140
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:11,442
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

141
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:20,700
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

142
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,842
May I take a cigarette?

143
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,700
Please.

144
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,882
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

145
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:56,161
Over the last 12 months,

146
00:10:56,162 --> 00:10:59,721
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

147
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:04,140
who you think might be able
to help you in your cause.

148
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:07,081
McCavern is one of these men.

149
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,161
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.

150
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,540
He killed an associate of mine.

151
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,202
I want to know what your strategy is.

152
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,780
That one's your brother, yes?

153
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:30,620
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.

154
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,642
We would like to talk business.

155
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:37,460
Michael.

156
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,482
Michael Gray.

157
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:44,361
You lost all your cousin's money
in America, playing the fool.

158
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:51,161
A nightclub in Detroit called the
Gladiator was your regular.

159
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:53,100
You lost the money...

160
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,900
...and found a wife there.

161
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:03,121
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing
there at the window

162
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,681
is afraid his wife will never return.

163
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,081
My spies tell me
she's been seen with another man.

164
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,601
Arthur...

165
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,180
Arthur.

166
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,494
_

167
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,960
And bingo.

168
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:23,201
20 seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

169
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:28,241
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

170
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:31,602
I will have need of men like you.

171
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,802
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

172
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:39,682
You, in particular, I need.

173
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,121
But, please,

174
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:46,401
don't imagine I would trouble myself
with turf wars.

175
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,441
You have many enemies.

176
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,100
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.

177
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:02,001
That investigation of the dead
journalist,

178
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,721
the queer...

179
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,522
...I've made that go away.

180
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:10,980
Read it and, uh, come back to me.

181
00:13:11,362 --> 00:13:15,700
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

182
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:00,002
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?

183
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:03,522
Fuck. Fuck.

184
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,220
Arthur!

185
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:14,820
Do not let them get inside your head.

186
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,081
That's exactly how these people work.

187
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:21,500
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?

188
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,922
Who the fuck are they?!

189
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,241
I've just been invited...

190
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:33,980
...to become the deputy leader
of a brand-new political party.

191
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:39,122
These people say they are the future.

192
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,081
Do you want a drink?

193
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,460
I've stopped.

194
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,780
So, what have you decided?

195
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,780
I've been talking to the Friends.

196
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,841
- What friends?
- Quakers.

197
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,780
Friends who meet at the meeting
house in Bournville.

198
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm staying in Bournville.

199
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,801
And what do they say?

200
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:21,180
They say I've been led astray.

201
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:27,390
If you've come to talk about redemption,

202
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,220
you're talking to the wrong person.

203
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:31,628
I also went to a solicitor.

204
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:36,380
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

205
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:40,480
To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

206
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,961
I found one.

207
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:44,522
He said he'd represent me.

208
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,801
But I put the phone down.

209
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:49,402
Not through fear.

210
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,041
I chose this life. It didn't choose me.

211
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:56,122
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is
a man.

212
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,260
He listens to me when I talk.

213
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:04,980
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

214
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,761
He has a daughter.

215
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:09,020
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

216
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,201
- Nothing has happened.
- Nor will it.

217
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:14,242
He would die without his eyes.

218
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:18,254
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

219
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,198
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

220
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,241
Or even take her into the family.

221
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,802
And it would begin again.

222
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,682
What is the thing, Linda?

223
00:16:33,722 --> 00:16:35,322
The thing you can't put aside?

224
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,762
It's not Arthur.

225
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,442
It's who I am when he's there.

226
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,881
God hears every filthy word in my head,

227
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,121
knows every dirty thing.

228
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,681
And your Friends don't use filthy words?

229
00:16:52,682 --> 00:16:55,700
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

230
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,322
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

231
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,001
I used to fuck seven men a day,

232
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:07,682
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

233
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:14,441
There's good and there's evil.

234
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,402
There's both mixed.

235
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,961
And that's Arthur and you... and me?

236
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:23,282
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

237
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:27,060
What about him?

238
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,761
He's making up his mind.

239
00:17:45,562 --> 00:17:48,500
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

240
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,580
Yes or no?

241
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:55,441
Yes.

242
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:18,961
I've come to take you to the clinic.

243
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,561
I already told Michael,
my husband or no-one.

244
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,401
I've got a car.

245
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,281
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

246
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,440
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,

247
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:29,681
they're going to give you options.

248
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:31,322
None of them are nice.

249
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,481
I had my check-up three days ago.

250
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:36,321
They heard a beating heart.

251
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:39,641
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

252
00:18:39,642 --> 00:18:41,482
I would have wanted someone with me.

253
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,001
My husband may do as he's told,

254
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,641
but, er, I don't.

255
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:50,401
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

256
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:52,201
cos you'll have the baby with you.

257
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,041
So I will leave you alone.

258
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:57,921
But if you get in a taxi in this
city and they hear your accent,

259
00:18:57,922 --> 00:18:59,962
they'll take you on a grand tour.

260
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,588
Come on.

261
00:19:09,522 --> 00:19:11,441
So, when will Mum be home?

262
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,226
She said she had to go to Birmingham.

263
00:19:13,227 --> 00:19:14,704
Do you want me to cook you something?

264
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,161
Cook?

265
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,842
You're a man.

266
00:19:22,082 --> 00:19:24,961
This is really not fair.

267
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:27,361
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

268
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,681
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

269
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,867
I beat people even older than you.

270
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,202
Even older than me?

271
00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:39,561
At school, some of the children say
that black people

272
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,361
and Jews are worse.

273
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,140
Worse than what?

274
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,482
Than anything.

275
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,921
And one teacher, Mr Hudson,

276
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,482
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

277
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:59,841
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

278
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,100
saying some very stupid things.

279
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,100
OK?

280
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:07,401
What do you think?

281
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:14,180
Checkmate.

282
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,500
I think, I don't want you to be my dad.

283
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:23,220
Cos my dad's white... and he's in heaven.

284
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,001
I came to see you in hospital to tell you

285
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,441
there's a strategy in place,

286
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,521
not to break you out.

287
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:53,202
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

288
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:58,420
You must stay here,

289
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:01,922
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

290
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,115
You're 45 today.

291
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,508
I'm probably a bit older than that.

292
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,002
Probably.

293
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,435
I've dealt death.

294
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:28,062
Now death has dealt with me.

295
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:33,620
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

296
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:40,208
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

297
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:39,081
Get a car and a driver.

298
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:42,241
Find out where the Fury family are
camped.

299
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:44,641
I need their men to help me.

300
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:48,721
I'll need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.

301
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:50,881
I'm going to Scotland.

302
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:52,500
Tonight.

303
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:10,561
I was expecting Ada.

304
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,601
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

305
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:15,481
I was meant to meet her today, but
she said had to go to Birmingham.

306
00:23:15,482 --> 00:23:18,281
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.
She's doing my job for me.

307
00:23:18,282 --> 00:23:21,441
- Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?
- He went to buy an ice cream.

308
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,761
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

309
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,441
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

310
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:28,202
We have some business for you.

311
00:23:40,322 --> 00:23:42,241
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,

312
00:23:42,242 --> 00:23:44,121
is meant to be strictly confidential.

313
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,400
Ah, Michael. You still
have shit on your shoes.

314
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,568
My associate here can evidently smell it.

315
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,881
- I don't mean any offence.
- Here, Michael, go and find Karl

316
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:54,681
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

317
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,420
The man doesn't trust you.

318
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,682
Fuck you, Tom.

319
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,420
You know Gina phoned.

320
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,187
The baby's heart's beating strong.

321
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,081
And I swear to God, Tom,

322
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,961
by the time that baby draws
its first breath,

323
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:22,202
you and I will be done.

324
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,761
And you will be king.

325
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:29,482
Is that it, Michael?

326
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,801
You know, Tom,

327
00:24:33,802 --> 00:24:35,761
there are doctors in London now

328
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:39,260
who can talk their way into your
head, dig out all the shit.

329
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,002
Perhaps, you should see one.

330
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:53,115
You're still not alone.

331
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:58,561
Me brother and I are the same person.

332
00:24:58,562 --> 00:24:59,681
Here.

333
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:01,441
Here's a letter from Mosley.

334
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:03,522
You should read it.

335
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:19,242
What investigation is he talking about?

336
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:24,921
Two weeks ago, a journalist was
killed in Maida Vale.

337
00:25:24,922 --> 00:25:28,081
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

338
00:25:28,082 --> 00:25:30,201
he was going to write about me.

339
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:32,481
We had nothing to do with that killing.

340
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:34,300
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

341
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,401
His constituency is Smethwick.

342
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,161
It borders my own. He wants
Birmingham as his stronghold.

343
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:43,641
He knows I've... strong support
among working people.

344
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:48,601
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

345
00:25:48,602 --> 00:25:51,841
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

346
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,361
A Minister of State

347
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:56,081
who may have seditious intentions.

348
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:58,201
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

349
00:25:58,202 --> 00:25:59,881
You work in intelligence, Younger.

350
00:25:59,882 --> 00:26:02,201
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

351
00:26:02,202 --> 00:26:05,481
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

352
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:09,641
My brief is specifically
to gather information

353
00:26:09,642 --> 00:26:11,682
on the activities of communists.

354
00:26:14,242 --> 00:26:17,561
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

355
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:20,641
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

356
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:25,820
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

357
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:29,601
They share membership of various
clubs in London and Birmingham.

358
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,041
I have specific orders.

359
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:32,481
I am a soldier.

360
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:35,322
You think you can join this family?

361
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:40,020
I have no intention of joining a family.

362
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:43,635
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

363
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,665
Thought you said this was about business.

364
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,161
Yes, family business
and government business,

365
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:49,962
all in one envelope.

366
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,481
Younger, listen to me.

367
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,241
Forget about Ada.

368
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,174
Forget about weddings.

369
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,220
You know what Mosley represents.

370
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,780
You know his philosophy.

371
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,801
I am planning to reply to him

372
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:12,020
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

373
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:15,881
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

374
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,361
I could fight him on my own, if I
have to,

375
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:21,881
or I could join his organisation

376
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:25,162
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

377
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:28,602
But you need to make a decision.

378
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:48,740
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

379
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,674
On your fucking feet.

380
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:20,900
Hello, Tom.

381
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:24,740
I thought you were staying over in
London.

382
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,020
Hello, Johnny.

383
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,380
How are you, eh?

384
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,580
How are your ribs?

385
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:35,081
You managing?

386
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:36,860
- Just about Tom, yeah.
- Yeah? Good.

387
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,540
And who's that?

388
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:44,100
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

389
00:28:44,882 --> 00:28:48,121
Ah! Sandra.

390
00:28:48,122 --> 00:28:50,041
Well, may I say,

391
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,300
your breakfasts are a great improvement.

392
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:57,961
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

393
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,980
Don't worry, Sandra.

394
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:02,681
The only way to get fired
from this household

395
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:05,020
is through burnt toast...

396
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:07,161
...or talking to the police.

397
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,940
Go on, go to bed.

398
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,374
And, Sandra...

399
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,801
...everything Johnny said is lies.

400
00:29:20,002 --> 00:29:21,441
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

401
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,441
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

402
00:29:25,442 --> 00:29:29,241
A cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

403
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,321
He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

404
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,481
to deal with his business himself,

405
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:36,722
and that you'd know what that meant.

406
00:29:38,562 --> 00:29:40,401
Fuck!

407
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:43,081
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital

408
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,922
in Polly's Bentley.

409
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:48,020
She fucking helped him.

410
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:53,060
She fucking helped him!

411
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:56,721
But it can't be love, cos it's Polly.

412
00:29:57,148 --> 00:29:58,788
Cos it's fucking Polly.

413
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,561
All right, Johnny. I have a job for you.

414
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:04,961
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

415
00:30:04,962 --> 00:30:06,921
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.

416
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:09,561
He has kin on the Lothian border,
the Fury family.

417
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:10,961
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!

418
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:14,361
The Furys, they don't even use words
to fucking talk.

419
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:16,321
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.

420
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,441
You will go to them
and you will find him.

421
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,281
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

422
00:30:20,282 --> 00:30:23,361
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was just managing.

423
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,921
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

424
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:28,481
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

425
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:31,641
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

426
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:34,561
I warned you, Tom. The Golds'll be
the death of one of us.

427
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:38,521
And it looks like it's going to be
fucking me!

428
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,860
Well, go on, open it.

429
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,048
So...

430
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:54,161
...you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

431
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:56,420
Beats so fast.

432
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,561
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

433
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,748
A new life.

434
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,060
Liberty.

435
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:10,620
Freedom.

436
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,460
Feels like a weapon.

437
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,580
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

438
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,980
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

439
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:28,780
So...

440
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:32,593
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

441
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:34,780
Mine.

442
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:39,601
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

443
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,195
Yes.

444
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:43,721
The baby will have two grandmothers.

445
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:44,881
The other one lives...

446
00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:47,441
The other one lives amongst human beings.

447
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,282
The other one is a human being.

448
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:55,401
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

449
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,481
I'm just free.

450
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,740
So, what do you want?

451
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,642
My approval?

452
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:07,380
Your help.

453
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:11,260
Michael wants you to come with us.

454
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:14,362
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

455
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:18,162
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

456
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:22,241
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

457
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:25,180
It's in New York, Polly.

458
00:32:27,042 --> 00:32:29,082
You see, we all try and get away.

459
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,740
But we never do.

460
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:47,820
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

461
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:55,127
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

462
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:00,740
I'm an American.

463
00:33:01,402 --> 00:33:03,721
We don't just go round
and round and round.

464
00:33:03,722 --> 00:33:05,300
We go in a straight line.

465
00:33:06,322 --> 00:33:10,660
And my baby... will be born in New York.

466
00:33:22,574 --> 00:33:25,740
I'm not happy about moving this
meeting to licensed premises.

467
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:32,401
You've saved your union the train
fare, and you hate London anyway.

468
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:35,721
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

469
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,921
You're making quite a name for
yourself in the Commons.

470
00:33:38,922 --> 00:33:40,420
Betty!

471
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,241
What are you drinking?

472
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,061
Water.

473
00:33:45,002 --> 00:33:47,721
- Bottle of champagne, Betty.
- You'll drink it on your own.

474
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:48,961
That's the idea.

475
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:50,802
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

476
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:18,540
Revolution.

477
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:23,442
So, how is life as a socialist?

478
00:34:25,682 --> 00:34:27,340
This glass.

479
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:29,681
The bubbles.

480
00:34:31,021 --> 00:34:32,861
They rise to the top.

481
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:37,321
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

482
00:34:37,322 --> 00:34:40,321
That is a very peculiar form of
socialism.

483
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:42,402
And this bottle.

484
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,660
Once the cork comes out...

485
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:49,641
...you can't get it back in.

486
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:51,562
You need to finish what you started.

487
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:55,482
It's cleverness, that's all.

488
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:00,900
So you're playing at this.

489
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,420
People can be turned around.

490
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,721
Even your people.

491
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,801
- My people?
- Yeah.

492
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,281
For them, it's just the same.

493
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,140
Communism. Fascism.

494
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:16,041
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

495
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,201
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

496
00:35:18,202 --> 00:35:20,660
I want you to speak against it.

497
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:22,842
In answer to your question...

498
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,962
...I cannot address your rally...

499
00:35:27,362 --> 00:35:29,980
...because it's not part
of the current strategy.

500
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,100
Are you OK, Thomas?

501
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:37,961
Do you want a man to carry you home?

502
00:35:39,802 --> 00:35:43,220
I knew we should not have had this
meeting on licensed premises.

503
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:00,140
Happy or sad, Thomas?

504
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:15,260
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

505
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:32,002
I didn't expect you home.

506
00:36:35,722 --> 00:36:38,340
Frances said Linda was here today.

507
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,842
Frances has a very
specific loyalty, doesn't she?

508
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:47,220
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

509
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:53,041
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

510
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,340
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

511
00:36:56,522 --> 00:36:58,802
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

512
00:37:04,202 --> 00:37:06,220
He said he'd represent me.

513
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,220
But I put the phone down.

514
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:12,768
There and then, I made a decision.

515
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:19,140
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

516
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:26,300
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

517
00:37:27,682 --> 00:37:30,041
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

518
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:31,881
and balance my heart against my head,

519
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,100
as though it were a book of accounts.

520
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:38,042
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

521
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:46,541
When was the last time you had to
worry about shillings, eh?

522
00:37:47,762 --> 00:37:51,100
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

523
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:53,922
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

524
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:58,340
But this is the deal.

525
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:01,721
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

526
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:03,881
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

527
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,780
A day on either side.

528
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:10,681
And you let me in sometimes.

529
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,602
Into your head.

530
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,387
To clear it out.

531
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,460
That what needs clearing out.

532
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,254
Agreed.

533
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:28,860
And this...

534
00:38:29,722 --> 00:38:31,482
Always.

535
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:34,761
The deal is...

536
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,460
...you belong to me.

537
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,340
My property.

538
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:42,435
No-one touches my property.

539
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:48,801
I touch myself, but it's still you
anyway.

540
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:51,100
So that's why I put the phone down.

541
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,321
No, Tom.

542
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,602
We do it in the bed at least.

543
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:19,060
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

544
00:39:21,022 --> 00:39:22,820
Everything.

545
00:39:53,842 --> 00:39:55,420
Arthur.

546
00:39:56,082 --> 00:39:58,001
- Hmm?
- Frances was right.

547
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,441
Linda was here today.

548
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:01,121
Fuck.

549
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:03,262
What did she say, huh?

550
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:06,681
- I just want to talk to her, that's all.
- Arthur, listen.

551
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:09,161
First, I need you to go to Scotland

552
00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:10,961
and bring back Aberama Gold.

553
00:40:10,962 --> 00:40:12,521
Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.

554
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:14,921
No, no, no, no.

555
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,962
I'll keep calling you, Tom.

556
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,740
You know I will.

557
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,460
I'll call this number back...

558
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:28,401
...again, again and again.

559
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:29,801
If you don't answer,

560
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,001
I'll jump in my fucking car

561
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:34,522
and I'll drive to your house,
you know I will.

562
00:40:36,322 --> 00:40:39,721
I'll stay there all night if
I have to. I won't go nowhere,

563
00:40:39,722 --> 00:40:41,481
not Scotland

564
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:44,380
till you tell me what it is you know.

565
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:56,601
Right, listen to me.

566
00:40:56,602 --> 00:40:58,300
I don't have an address.

567
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,915
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

568
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:06,162
Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.

569
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:12,001
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

570
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,801
And he has a daughter.

571
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,801
That should be enough to find him.

572
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,321
Arthur...

573
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:20,860
Just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

574
00:41:21,602 --> 00:41:24,300
Nothing happened, Arthur.

575
00:41:24,802 --> 00:41:26,801
He's a Quaker, a Friend.

576
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:29,041
They're not like us, they talk.

577
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:31,881
Oh, I'll speak to him.

578
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:33,740
Man to man.

579
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:36,721
And then, after that...

580
00:41:36,722 --> 00:41:39,041
...I'll go up north, hmm.

581
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:42,401
Deal with our business. I promise you.

582
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:45,020
Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...

583
00:42:00,402 --> 00:42:02,540
Who were you talking to?

584
00:42:03,082 --> 00:42:06,281
I have to ask you, cos Maggie at the
exchange won't tell me.

585
00:42:06,282 --> 00:42:07,900
Who was it?

586
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,900
Was it Arthur?

587
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,641
I need my brother in one piece.

588
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:16,348
Arthur makes his own decisions.

589
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:20,241
You marry a Shelby,

590
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,500
you stay fucking married.

591
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,414
Fuck.

592
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:33,081
Well, look at this, hmm.

593
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:34,561
Can I help you?

594
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:36,961
Yeah, I think you can.

595
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:39,881
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

596
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:41,488
Do you know her?

597
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,220
Eh? I'm Arthur.

598
00:42:46,282 --> 00:42:47,780
Her husband.

599
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,602
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

600
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,091
Well, look at you.

601
00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:59,401
Ain't you smart? Eh?

602
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:02,481
What, you got all the fucking
answers, have you?

603
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:05,161
Well, let's try you with another one. Eh?

604
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,681
Let's try you with another one.
How about...

605
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:12,721
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

606
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,881
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a look.

607
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,601
See what we've got inside here, eh?

608
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:18,922
You fucking bastard!

609
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:28,921
Eh? You want to keep looking, eh?

610
00:44:12,642 --> 00:44:17,001
Hey, I will ask you again.

611
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:19,401
Eh? Eh?

612
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:21,562
I'll ask you again.

613
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:27,481
Where is she? Eh?

614
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:29,762
Where is she?

615
00:44:32,922 --> 00:44:35,001
- Eh? Eh?
- No. No, no, no...

616
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:07,794
I'm a good man.

617
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:11,860
I'm a fucking good man, like you.

618
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:18,300
A God-fearing man.

619
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:21,820
There is good in my heart.

620
00:45:22,442 --> 00:45:25,180
There is good in my heart!

621
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:33,681
But my hands...

622
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:36,468
These hands belong to the devil.

623
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:40,227
The fucking devil!

624
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,922
Wait... Who are you?

625
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:14,500
Did she come back?

626
00:46:15,761 --> 00:46:17,699
No.

627
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:21,881
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

628
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:24,122
No, she's not in fucking
Scotland, Charlie.

629
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:29,281
Whisky. We want whisky.

630
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:31,801
Maps. Cigars.

631
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,401
Load the van, we want it all.

632
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:34,761
Who's "we?"

633
00:46:34,762 --> 00:46:36,281
Me and Johnny Dogs.

634
00:46:36,282 --> 00:46:37,620
Ah.

635
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:40,842
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland?

636
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:46,121
You know, at the BSA,
our friends could get you

637
00:46:46,122 --> 00:46:49,801
some of them new artillery cannons
that fire ten shells a second.

638
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:52,921
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

639
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:56,046
Petrol. We need petrol.

640
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,260
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

641
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:04,940
Yeah. Still riding round on fucking
chariots, they are.

642
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:11,641
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

643
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:14,881
- How many?
- Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

644
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:17,801
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

645
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,841
but we can't give them...

646
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:22,921
Get me some hand grenades, Curly,
eh? Hmm?

647
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:25,641
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

648
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,081
You get me some. Put them on my account.

649
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:29,402
Yeah.

650
00:47:31,802 --> 00:47:33,321
How many?

651
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:35,482
- Three, Curly.
- Three. Three.

652
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,260
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.

653
00:47:46,922 --> 00:47:49,820
Without her, you're as
good as dead already.

654
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:17,180
That's them, the Billy Boys!

655
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:39,601
Gentlemen.

656
00:48:39,602 --> 00:48:44,580
You have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

657
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:48,361
Now, according
to the unwritten constitution

658
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:51,121
of Tollcross County,

659
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:56,121
Gypsies, Catholics and other
criminally minded individuals

660
00:48:56,122 --> 00:48:59,641
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district

661
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:02,761
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

662
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:06,641
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

663
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:09,561
We will be needing your tools,

664
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:12,401
your tar, your burner...

665
00:49:12,402 --> 00:49:14,940
...and your transportation.

666
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:17,081
You're Gypsies,

667
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:19,380
you can easily steal another.

668
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:23,460
I have the keys to the truck.

669
00:49:49,522 --> 00:49:51,162
Ah!

670
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,682
Now...

671
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:22,361
...I want you boys to take a message
back to Jimmy McCavern.

672
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:24,121
You killed my son.

673
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,260
You hoisted him on a cross!

674
00:50:29,622 --> 00:50:31,102
Now, in this gun...

675
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,521
...there's a bullet

676
00:50:34,522 --> 00:50:38,122
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

677
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:45,241
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

678
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:50,180
it will be me who drives in the nails.

679
00:51:33,162 --> 00:51:35,601
Mr Shelby!

680
00:51:35,602 --> 00:51:37,420
At last you are alone.

681
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:41,580
I think we'll make quite the team.

682
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:45,601
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

683
00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:52,500
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

684
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:55,620
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

685
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:58,521
Were you cavalry?

686
00:51:58,522 --> 00:52:01,441
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.

687
00:52:01,442 --> 00:52:02,522
That'll help.

688
00:52:03,974 --> 00:52:05,014
With what?

689
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,761
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

690
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:10,122
I met Mr Mussolini.

691
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:13,500
You and I and men like him...

692
00:52:15,242 --> 00:52:16,962
...we will shape the future.

693
00:52:19,362 --> 00:52:21,460
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

694
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:27,340
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

695
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:35,100
The British Union of Fascists will
be born on January 1st of next year.

696
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:37,620
The first day of a new decade.

697
00:52:39,962 --> 00:52:43,660
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

698
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,042
Did you bring that cigar?

699
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:52,820
Before we smoke...

700
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:54,900
...I have some conditions.

701
00:52:57,148 --> 00:52:59,820
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

702
00:53:03,522 --> 00:53:06,540
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

703
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,881
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

704
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:27,020
I have an allocated confidential
line, code 78.

705
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:30,658
It's me.

706
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,820
I've agreed to work with our friend.

707
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:37,161
He's going to announce on January 1st.

708
00:53:37,162 --> 00:53:40,161
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

709
00:53:40,162 --> 00:53:42,082
is officially sanctioned.

710
00:53:48,882 --> 00:53:51,601
Today, gentlemen,

711
00:53:51,602 --> 00:53:55,281
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

712
00:53:55,282 --> 00:53:57,721
on members of our organisation

713
00:53:57,722 --> 00:54:01,700
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

714
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:04,241
Our enemies are Gypsies,

715
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:09,081
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

716
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:12,322
due to what the
scientists call selection.

717
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:17,961
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

718
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:20,441
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

719
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:24,860
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

720
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:31,620
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

721
00:54:39,522 --> 00:54:41,449
Morning, Mr Gold.

722
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:45,321
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

723
00:54:45,322 --> 00:54:47,002
How the fuck did you find me?

724
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:51,961
- How the fuck did they find me?
- I kind of let it slip.

725
00:54:51,962 --> 00:54:56,020
Give you no choice, eh? What, hmm? What?

726
00:55:04,002 --> 00:55:06,321
And a Bentley outside, the engine
running.

727
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:08,801
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

728
00:55:08,802 --> 00:55:11,761
We've got two minutes to get out of here.

729
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:34,321
We are officers of the East
Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

730
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:37,842
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

731
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:43,682
Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.

732
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,722
Fuck! Take cover!

733
00:56:50,402 --> 00:56:52,001
So, Tommy Shelby...

734
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,540
...it's war you want...

735
00:56:57,962 --> 00:57:00,042
...it's war you shall have.
