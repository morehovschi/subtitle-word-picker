They're coming and they're here to
stay.

00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,620
- The intelligence services in London
sent seven officers to Birmingham.

- Stop drinking whisky, switch to
stout,

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,700
then go and see a doctor about that
baby.

Make sure Tommy keeps that Friday
free.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,020
Tell him I have an appointment for
him.

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,700
- You've agreed to give up Tommy...

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,740
..to save my life.

14

- This programme contains some violent
scenes and very strong language

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,900
- Shoot out his tyres.

16
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,900
But remember, I fire the final shot!

Or his. I'm a police officer, Tommy,

I'm a fucking police officer, right?

- No. Enough.

60
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,660
Tell the people who live in these
houses

61
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,580
that they are free to go about their
lawful business.

62
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,700
Tell them that the rule of law has
been restored.

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,980
Haven't you heard, Tommy? Hey?

64
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,500
Soldiers are coming.

65
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,420
- Do you know, I remember the very
first time

66
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,660
you head butted a policeman.

67
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,340
And after you got your OBE from the
King,

68
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,380
I didn't think there'd be a next
time.

69
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,420
What do you think you're going to
tell Arthur?

70
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,380
- I'll tell him the truth.

71
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,300
- They're here.

72
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,060
- So. What the fuck happened today,
Tom?

73
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,460
We all heard - shooting in Artillery
Square.

74
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,620
- Yeah, there was.

75
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,340
Today I killed three men.

76
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,020
Now our enemies are down to eight.

77
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,140
- I suppose they, er, I suppose they
took you by surprise, did they?

78
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,860
- No. I knew they were coming.

79
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,780
- Just after Christmas, I received a
letter from Luca Changretta...

80
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,660
..offering to spare my son if I gave
up Tommy...

81
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,460
..and I gave Tommy up.

82
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,620
- Because that was the plan that
Polly and I agreed on.

83
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,860
I knew that Luca would want to pull
the trigger himself,

84
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,100
so I used the set-up as bait to
bring him here.

85
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,100
- You're a fucking idiot, Tom!

86
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,420
- Look, I didn't get Luca but I got
three, all right? That's it.

87
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,580
That's what happened.

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,580
I mean, I thought you'd gone soft.

91
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,100
So you got three?

92
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,420
- Yeah, I got three.

93
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,420
- Well, I'll drink to you, Tom, you
mad bastard.

94
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,260
- Pretty soon you'll... You're going
to get the shakes

95
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,060
when your blood cools down. Let's go
and get a drink.

- Dad? You got three what?

97
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,140
- I got three shillings for a two
shilling horse, my boy.

98
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,180
You come with us, eh?

You want a drink, Lizzie? I've had a
hard day.

101
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,500
- I don't drink whisky or gin any
more, Tom.

102
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,780
- Why not?

103
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,860
- Because they say it harms the
baby.

104
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,900
Yes, it can only be yours.

105
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,380
That day by the canal

106
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,700
when you were fucking somebody else
in your head.

107
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,620
Except it wasn't her who got
pregnant.

108
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,060
- Have a seat, Lizzie.

109
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,220
All right, I know a woman, Lizzie...

110
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,340
- You know lots of women, Tommy.

111
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,860
If you don't know this already, you
don't know me -

112
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,020
I'm keeping it.

113
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,660
- Who's going to run my fucking
office?

114
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
- You'll find somebody.

115
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,460
- Well, you'd better put a fucking
advert in the paper, then.

116
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,060
- I'm not laid up yet.

117
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,060
- You'll not go to work with a child
of mine inside of you.

118
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,060
Fuck, now my hand shakes...

119
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,940
- It's OK, Tom. We'll be OK.

120
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,380
- All this death, Lizzie. Fuck,
let's have some life, eh?

121
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,260
I got three.

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,140
- One of them point-blank.

124
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,500
- A baby. A little you and me.

125

- Point-blank, Lizzie.

126
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,380
And he looked up at me.

127
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,580
You'll get an allowance...

128
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,100
..every week, from the company.

129

We'll, erm, buy a nice house, eh?

131
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,300
Come on, I'll drive you home.

Linda, I need you to save

- I'm getting back in this car.

- Michael, you're number two on Luca
Changretta's hit list.

157
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,740
- Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

158

They don't even know where they'll
be tomorrow.

163
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,020
They follow the Patrin and the
crows.

164
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,900
- And if anyone should come for you,
Michael,

165
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,220
the Palmers and the Boswells will
put up a fair fight.

166
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,540
- Take your medicine.

167
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,100
- I'll take them.
- Your painkillers...

168
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,180
- The healers up there will heal you
much quicker.

169
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,860
- Fucking witches, the lot of them.

170
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,460
- Show some respect, Mr Gray.

171
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,780
They have agreed to welcome you on
account of your blood.

172
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,220
- Take your medicine, take the gun.

173
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,060
I won't be able to contact you, so
you phone me.

174
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,260
We'll make a plan.

175
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,780
Tommy says it won't be long. Then
we'll be free.

176
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,140
You might learn something.

177
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,980
Tell them your grandmother was a
Gypsy princess,

178
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,860
name of Birdie Boswell.

179
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,180
You're royalty up there, Michael.

180
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,100
- Is that true, Mrs Gray?

181
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,580
- What? Don't I look like royalty?

182
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,540
- Now that you mention it, you do.

183
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,580
- I've been cooped up in Small Heath
too long.

184
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,860
I can smell spring in the air.

185
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,260
Do you know a longer way back, Mr
Gold?

186
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,500
- I know ways back that would take
forever.

187
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,100
Get in, Your Majesty.

188
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,700
- I thought you were a busy woman.

189
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,700
Do you have time for this?

190
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,060
- Is it a buck?

191
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,100
- It is a buck.

192
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,060
- Good. Bucks taste better.

193
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,460
In the smoke I'm 16 again.

194
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,420
You know, when the police were after
him, our dad used to take us out.

195
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,780
We'd be gone for days, living on
what he caught.

196
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,100
Oh, do you have a sharp knife?

197
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,940
- I heard you have second sight.

198
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,700
I heard that you speak with the
dead.

199
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,340
- Yes.

200
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,540
Your wife is often around you.

201
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,940
She watches you.

202
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,780
- Is she watching me now?

203
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,060
- No.

204
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,540
- Your family were healers?

205
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,420
- Yeah, a long time ago.

206
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,300
Came back when I put my head in the
noose.

207
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,380
It's like putting your head through
a window and seeing the whole world.

208
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,460
Give me the rabbit...

209
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,860
..and the knife.

210
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,380
- You know, Polly, I believe it's
you who's kept Tommy Shelby alive

211
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,940
all these years.

212
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,740
- Oh, we've kept each other alive.

213
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,940
But I didn't just put my head
through that window...

214
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,180
..I climbed through it.

215
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,780
First I thought it was madness, but
no.

216
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,780
When you've put your head out of
that window

217
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,860
you can do anything you want, cos
there are no rules...

218
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,580
..cos there are no risks.

219
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,060
Now give me the knife.

220
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,700
Now, come here.

221
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,020
I can do whatever I want...

222
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,060
..whenever the mood takes me.

223
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,060
And you are a strong, handsome
man...

224
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,500
..and this is a beautiful place in
the world...

225
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,660
..and it is this time...

226
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,260
But let me make one thing clear, Mr
Gold,

227
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,860
I just gave Michael a little speech

228
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,220
about how no-one would know how to
find him...

229
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,900
..but you'd know how to get him.

230
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,940
If any harm comes to Michael, you
shall have me as your enemy.

231
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,980
And none of your knives can kill me.

232
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,020
Do you understand?

233
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,220
- Oh, I understand.

234
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,420
Tute's a rinkeni moola. Abri.

235
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,980
Mr Solomons?

236
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,180
- Hm!

237
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,380
My little cousin was born blind,

238
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:33,780
but as a result I now donate a
considerable sum of money

239
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,980
to a charity which gives dogs with
eyes to blind Jews.

240
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,500
The chairman of the board recommends
that those of us

241
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,380
who were blessed with the gift of
sight,

242
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,940
that we spend, you know,

243
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,340
at least half an hour of our day
with our eyes closed

244
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,860
so that we may, well, we may better
understand the, er...

245
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,780
..the darkness and also to increase
our donations and that.

246
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,980
What time is it?

247
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,780
- 29 minutes past eight.
- Right.

248
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,660
Well, then I have...I have another
minute to go, actually,

249
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,260
but you, er, you can begin.

250
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,300
Go on.

251
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,500
- I'm Luca Changretta.

252
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,780
- Oh, yeah, I know who you are.

253
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,020
You are a bit of a failure, aren't
you?

254
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,420
You come all the way over here to
this country

255
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,300
in order to kill Tommy Shelby,

256
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,020
but, I mean, well, he's not dead, is
he?

257
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,140
So...
- No.

258
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,780
- No.
- He ain't.

259
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,540
- How much time have I got left,
mate?

260
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,620
- Ten seconds, nine seconds,

261
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,660
eight seconds...

262
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:10,580
..five, four, three, two, one.

263
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,180
- Right, hello. How can I help you?

264
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,940
- I have a proposition for you.

265
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,820
- Hmm, yeah, it's... I already know
what you want, yeah,

266
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,820
but I just want to hear you say it
out loud

267
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,500
so I can check how ridiculous it is.

268
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,700
- OK.

269
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,580
We hear there's going to be a little
fight, you know,

270
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,860
a boxing match,

271
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,820
between your boy and Tommy Shelby's
boy, in Birmingham.

272
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,980
- Yep.

273
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,380
- And the whole Shelby family's
going to be there.

274
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,940
And you, Mr Solomons, you too will
be there.

275
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,420
- That's it. I'll tell you what,
right?

276
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,340
Here's a gift, it's free - a
souvenir of your visit here.

277
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,020
Goodbye, trot on. Down there is
Bonnie Street.

278
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,380
- You know, they say you are a smart
guy.

279
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,740
You already know what we want before
we say it.

280
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,900
That's funny cos now

281
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,860
I believe I know what you want even
before you say it.

282
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,660
- So, you going to taste it?

283
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,660
Damn fucking straight, mate,

284
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,580
otherwise you wouldn't still be
thieving my oxygen, would you?

285
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,740
Because I have 200 barrels a month,
yeah,

286
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:16,380
cleared by your people, distributed
through your teamsters.

287
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,980
- Thing is that people want gin
these days.

288
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:26,380
- Well, the exit is still out there,
right, on Bonnie Street. Yeah?

289
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,540
- You're fucking crazy, you know
that? 200 barrels, ah?

290
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,500
What do you think, cousin?

291
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,140
- But also I want some cash...

292
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,980
..bung work. That's why I've broken
it down here -

293
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,220
a list of costs pertaining to the
assassination

294
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,940
of a dear friend, all right?

295
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,580
Now, a normal dispatch, well, it's,
you know, £500 cost.

296
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,340
But you're going to have to add
another 100 to that

297
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:01,220
because Tommy Shelby, like me, is
from an oppressed people,

298
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,420
and I need you to put another tonne
on top of that

299
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,460
because his brother is a fucking
animal and he will come after me.

300
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,420
And then you will need to put
another 100 on top of that

301
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,060
because, well, you are a fucking
wop, mate, hmmm?

302
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,100
And you.

303
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,860
And then we've got to deal with the
ugly business,

304
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,740
which I've been incredibly clear of
before.

305
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,540
I will need another £500,

306
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,820
because, like I stated, Tommy Shelby

307
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,740
is a very, very good friend of mine.

308
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,220
Total...

309
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,620
..is down there in black and white,
all right? Crack on.

310
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,700
- It's OK.

311
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,620
Mr Solomons, I'm going to be very
fucking clear with you.

312
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,580
I don't need you to kill anybody.

313
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,820
I have people that I trust.

314
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,700
So, you're going to take my boys

315
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,740
and you're going to bring them to
the ring as seconds.

316
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,020
- Well, in order to qualify as my
seconds

317
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,940
they would first have to qualify as
being Jewish.

318
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,060
Yeah?

319
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,060
And in order to do that, they would
have to replace their natural

320
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,020
Italian fucking arrogance with a
Jewish air of absolute certainty.

321
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,220
See, my good friend Thomas Shelby,
he will know the difference.

322
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,780
- These days, back in the old
country, a lot of the, er, you know,

323
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,620
the Jewish people, they, er...

324
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,060
..they are having to pass themselves
off as Italian.

325
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,220
- Right, well, you will have to add
another tonne on to your bill

326
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,700
for being a cunt, mate.

327
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,540
All right?

328
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,500
- You will bring my men to
Birmingham?

329
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,460
- You will circumcise them.

330
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,860
You will have to circumcise them
because the Peakys will check.

331
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,900
Yeah?

332
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,220
- OK. Any other request, eh?

333
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,820
200 fucking barrels, we have a deal.

334
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,260
- Nah.

335
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,220
- What going on?
- Oh, well.

336
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,140
- I said we have a deal.

337
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:32,380
- Aye, you've just made a deal
without negotiation, didn't you?

338
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,900
Yeah, Tommy Shelby was right about
you, weren't he?

339
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,460
- Ada Shelby?

340
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,820
- No.

341
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,700
- She was armed when we picked her
up, sir, so we strip searched her.

342
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,020
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,580
- I apologise, Miss Shelby,

344
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,380
the Territorials can be over
zealous.

345
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,900
- Your men watched.

346
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,540
- Then they will be reprimanded.

347
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,700
- They won't see Saturday.

348
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,900
- A naked woman, alone, making threats
against the entire British Army -

349
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,140
a significant indicator of
character.

350
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,180
I'll turn my back while you dress
and perhaps we can talk.

351
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,860
I have a dossier on each member of
your family.

352
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,180
I know your family's extraordinary
history.

353
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,980
- Ah, fuck you.

354
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,180
- I also have a totally blank page
on which together

355
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,500
we can write your family's immediate
future.

356
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,420
- You rehearsed your speech -

357
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,420
significant indicator of a lack of
confidence.

358
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,740
What rank are you?
- Colonel. May I turn...?

359
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,340
- Not unless you want to get
blinded.

360
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,860
- I'm sorry. This has got off to a
bad start.

361
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,540
- What is "this"?

362
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,500
- Three days ago you were seen at a
meeting

363
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
for the Stetchford Communist Party.

364
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,340
You were then seen talking to a
woman called Jessie Eden.

365
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,420
- Turn around.

366
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,100
I'm leaving.

367
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,380
And you can burn this. It's history.

368
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
- Ada Shelby.

369
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,380
A person of interest and under the
surveillance of Special Branch

370
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,580
since you joined the Birmingham
Communist Party in June 1919.

371
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,940
- I'm no longer a member of the
Communist Party.

372
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,820
- I know. Irrelevant.

373
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,700
Most of the more active subversives

374
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,460
shed their official allegiances to
avoid detection.

375
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,300
- Look, OK, let me explain it to
you.

376
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,180
I'm no longer a member of the
Communist Party

377
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,900
because I'm no longer a believer in
the cause of socialism.

378
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,660
Now, open that door!

379
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,460
- So, in the past, you were blinded
by love.

380
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:51,260
- No, blinded by faith. I believed
people deserve justice. They don't.

381
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,860
So, you've arrested me because I had
a drink with Jessie Eden.

382
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,500
- Whisky with ice for you, and a
beer for her.

383
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,820
- I met Jessie Eden to settle an
industrial dispute.

384
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,540
- Head of acquisitions. So, you've
swapped sides.

385
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,180
- If you know what I drink, you know
what I do for a living.

386
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:20,620
- Mrs Shelby, you must understand
that these are extraordinary times.

387
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,660
A general strike is certain, an
attempted revolution perhaps,

388
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,980
soldiers on the streets very soon.

389
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,140
They're already drilling.

390
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,380
And here stands you, a woman with
her foot in both camps.

391
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,780
Potentially very useful.

392
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,540
- Useful to who?

393
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,540
- Maybe you should ask your brother,
Thomas.

394
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,180
- Put some fucking effort into it,
son.

395
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,860
The fight is in two days.

396
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,260
Get used to the reach.

397
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,980
Get used to the long arm on him.

398
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,380
Just get under it!

399
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,740
That's it, under his body.

400
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,380
- Talk to me about Colonel Ben
Younger.

401
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,340
- What about him?

402
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,300
- He's just made me a proposition.

403
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,980
- You're in my chair.

404
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,900
- He said you knew about it.

405
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,020
And, remember, I know when you're
lying.

406
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,980
- Ben Younger was an officer

407
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,420
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry in
Flanders.

408
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,300
The only cavalryman who could ride a
fucking horse.

409
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,140
- I was strip searched.

410
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,060
Two soldiers watched.

411
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
- I'm sorry, Ada.

412
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,460
The arrest was so the neighbours
would see and word would go round.

413
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,860
Younger is all right.

414
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,540
Younger came to me for help.

415
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,660
He's been given Birmingham.

416
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,060
- "Given Birmingham" by who?

417
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,500
- By Churchill, by the fucking King,

418
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,180
by people who want to stop a
revolution.

419
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,900
No-one's laughing any more, Ada.

420
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,060
The Home Office is making
provisions.

421
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,980
This is part of those provisions.

422
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,340
- And how is Tommy Shelby OBE going
to stop a revolution?

423
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,060
- Jessie Eden has accepted my
invitation to dinner.

424
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,940
- Ah. Of course!

425
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,980
I'm sorry, Tommy Shelby is going to
stop the revolution with his cock!

426
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,180
- It's not her the military are
interested in,

427
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,340
it's the people around her.

428
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,380
They're people like you used to be,
like Freddie used to be.

429
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,340
People who want an armed revolution.

430
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,220
If I get Jessie Eden's trust...

431
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,420
..she gives me the nose of the
instigators...

432
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,140
..I give 'em up to the Crown forces.

433
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,500
- Tommy, Tommy, sweetheart...

434
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,380
..why would a man whose medals rust

435
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,820
at the bottom of the Saltley canal
want to help the British military?

436
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:55,420
- Because I've been offered three
five-year contracts to supply

437
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,540
military vehicles to the British
forces

438
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,460
in India, Ceylon, Singapore and
Burma,

439
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,100
total value - £2 million.

440
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,180
- And there'll be no strikes in your
factory

441
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,180
because Jessie Eden will be in your
bed.

442
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,380
Tommy, this can only happen if
you're still alive.

443
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,140
- I'm planning on staying alive.

444
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,940
If I'm dead, you can all go back to
being what you were.

445
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,780
The British Army came to me, Ada.

446
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,420
I said, "Why not?"

447
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,620
- They'll put that on your grave,
Tom.

448
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,100
'Tommy Shelby - "Why not?"'

449
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,260
- Are you going to help me or not?

450
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,180
- Other way round.

451
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,100
- Will they want music, Charlie?

452
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,220
We have that gramophone

453
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,940
we found abandoned inside that
gentleman's car.

454
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,940
- No, they don't. Tommy said they're
here to talk.

455
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,980
- DOOR OPENS

456
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,620
Charlie, Curly, this is Jessie Eden.

457
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,900
Jessie, this is my Uncle Charlie and
my...whatever Curly is.

458
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:51,260
- This is actually lovely.

459
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,540
- We were just wondering if you'd
like some music.

460
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,300
- No, we weren't.
- Actually, Jessie likes music.

461
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,540
- Don't go to any trouble.

462
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,620
- No, Curly, go to some trouble.

463
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,340
- Go on, then.

464
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,300
Right...

465
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,180
- Don't I get a choice?

466
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,620
- I want an opinion. Try it.

467
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,300
- I don't really drink gin.

468
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,820
- Then you're perfect.

469
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,100
My gin is for women that don't
really drink gin.

470
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,460
- Your gin?

471
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:50,100
- Let's drink to something. You
choose.

472
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,140
- To the revolution.

473
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,860
- Why not?

474
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,340
- To the revolution.
- The revolution.

475
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,580
Right, well, since I invited you for
dinner, I thought I'd cook.

476
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,700
These two beauties were shot this
morning

477
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,980
by a poacher friend of mine on Lord
Packwood's estate.

478
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,620
I thought you'd like that.

479
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,620
And these here, these were stolen
from under his trees.

480
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,100
- Mr Shelby...

481
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,060
..I came to talk business.

482
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,820
- Yes, so did I.

483
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,300
Wage cuts withdrawn,

484
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,900
parity between men and women
guaranteed.

485
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,340
You can instruct your members to
return to work tomorrow.

486
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,260
- And all I have to do in return

487
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,620
is tell you everything I know about
socialism.

488
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,140
That's what your sister said.

489
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,460
- You don't like your gin?

490
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,260
- It's OK.

491
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,340
- It's OK?

492
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,980
- What do you want to know about the
cause?

493
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,820
- I'm approaching the current
political crisis

494
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,300
as I would approach a horse race...

495
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,060
..assessing the runners and the
riders.

496
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,860
Now, the favourite is, of course,
the King's horse.

497
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,540
But the King's horse was also the
favourite in 1913,

498
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,580
when Emily Davison threw herself in
front of it.

499
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,380
- You know the names of
suffragettes. I'm impressed.

500
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,580
- Everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look -

501
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,900
women with serious faces everywhere.

502
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,540
When I study a horse race, I study
form.

503
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,980
And then the other horse,

504
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,380
the one who wants to beat the King's
horse...

505
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,180
Let's call her Dangerous, shall we?

506
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,340
..she's no form.

507
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,900
That's what makes her so dangerous.

508
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,660
- Russia. Isn't that form?

509
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,220
- No, the Russians aren't like the
English. We're beer, they're petrol.

510
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,860
That's why I invited you here for
dinner.

511
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,180
I'm guessing you know people...

512
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,260
..people that want to make this
fight real,

513
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,740
with guns and ammunition.

514
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,340
So, before I place a bet on who's
going to win,

515
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,380
I need to know how strong they
are...

516
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,540
..how serious they are.

517
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,580
- Your concern is that if the
unthinkable happened...

518
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,780
..you would find yourself on the
wrong side of the barricades.

519
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,620
- Well, as you can see,

520
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,820
my natural side of the barricades is
the same as yours.

521
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,140
And, as you know, I once believed.

522
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,180
- But the war changed you.

523
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,380
- Yeah.

524
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,580
- The man I loved couldn't speak
when he got back.

525
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,620
Not one word.

526
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,380
- I've said very few true words
since.

527
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,460
- The men who blew the whistles in
France are our enemy.

528
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,580
- And you count yourself among those
who want a real fight?

529
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,380
- I do.

530
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,220
- Well, well.

531
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,300
- Yes. Not just in my dreams, in the
day now.

532
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,500
- And you're not alone.

533
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,980
- I am not alone.

534
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,980
- Well, well.

535
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,300
- I have researched you. We have
researched you.

536
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,420
You have never been a friend of the
Government.

537
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,140
They have used you.

538
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,660
And I imagine you have found out
already

539
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,540
that no amount of money allows you
to pass through the steel sheets

540
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,580
that separate class from class.

541
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,340
- Yes. Yes, that I have learnt.

542
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,740
- Men like you would terrify them -

543
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:14,140
a man better than them at what they
do.

544
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,260
- Would I change the odds, do you
think?

545
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,660
- It's all wound up, Tom.

546
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,060
Er, you just put the needle on and
let it spin.

00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,780
And there are some popular records.

548
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,540
Mostly romantic.

549
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,500
- Thank you, Curly.

550
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,900
Food's nearly ready.

551
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,180
Let's eat before we dance, shall we?

552
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,740
- So we're going to dance?

553
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,140
- I think so.

and a coconut?

thought we all did.

And I could never understand why
people like us

only had bread and fucking lard...
