- About what?
- About this!

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,880
This is the case of a family
of Birmingham gangsters

38
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,240
on trial for murder and sedition.

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Why would the King intervene?

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,880
The leader of the gang,
Thomas Shelby.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,480
He claims his family was caught up
in a wider conspiracy.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,320
- He names Winston Churchill.
- You woke me up for this?

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,720
And he also sent us this.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,360
How the fuck did
a Birmingham racketeer

45
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,920
get his hands on a personal letter
written by King George?

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,480
During a robbery at Hampton Court,

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,880
Shelby discovered
a box of correspondence.

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,360
Among the papers he stole was
that letter from the King himself,

49
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
which proves
His Majesty was involved.

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, utter fuck.

51
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
If his family walks free, then he
will burn the papers in my presence.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,440
- When are they due to hang?
- Today.

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
This morning, in Winson Green Prison.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
Why the hell didn't you
bring it up before?!

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
The plan was for the Lord Chamberlain

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,400
to intervene at the appeal
but late last night

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
some local judge brought
the executions forward.

58
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
Oh, my giddy aunt!

59
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Put me through to His Majesty.

It was me who gave her the time off.

Not a toy. A thoroughbred.

I told you, you didn't need to come
on Christmas Eve.

165
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I could have dealt with it.

166
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah? Like you dealt with it
at the Pressings factory.

167
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Well, this is the same problem.

168
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,640
Same fucking union convenor.

169
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,960
Area convenor for the Boilermakers'
Union has got involved in something

170
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,080
that could have otherwise been fixed
with a drink and a bribe.

171
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,280
- The wire-cutting shop?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Now, all the wire-cutters
here are women.

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,680
That's why the union convenor
thinks they're being underpaid.

174
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, tell him there are no men
in the cutting shops,

175
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
so there can be no comparatives.

176
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,040
- It's a woman.
- What is?

177
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,280
The union convenor
causing all the trouble.

178
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,080
- Fuck!
- Her name's Jessie Eden.

179
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,080
- You heard of her?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you want me in the meeting?

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
No.

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
Michael?

183
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,400
Look...sometimes I have
a sniff of snow, so what?

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,040
How's your mother?

185
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,160
I drove past her house.
The drainpipe was hanging off.

186
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,400
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

187
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,160
Very long hours these days,
and when I do sleep,

188
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
I dream about what happened.

189
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,640
I wasn't asking
about you, Michael, was I?

190
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
I was asking about your mother.

191
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,000
Since she was pardoned,
she's been on these fucking tablets

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,160
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

193
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,400
She says that when she was
inside the noose...she saw spirits.

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
She's running seances,

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,280
but people just come into
the house to steal things.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
- Tommy, it's bad.
- All right, all right.

197
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,760
Hm! Now, listen to me, Michael...

198
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,000
..the spirits she sees are real.

199
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Believe they're real.

200
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Believe it with her.

201
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,360
Then eventually...

202
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,440
you can take the remembered noose
from around her neck...

203
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,320
..like a horse that's
been choked off.

204
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,160
Keep her off whisky,
throw away the tablets...

205
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
..and stop giving her fucking snow.

206
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
Fuck, Tommy, that sounded like
family advice.

207
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Are you coming back?

208
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
Nothing to come back to.

209
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,440
Truth is, they're all fucked.

210
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520

And, barefoot, I grew up mean.

323
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, yeah, you know everything.

324
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,880
- Your turn of phrase...
- Is unacceptable?

325
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,800
You grew up mean, you say? A threat
in there, I think, somewhere.

326
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,720
- No threats.
- The whole of Birmingham knows you, Mr Shelby.

327
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,080
Sweetheart...whatever you've heard,
I don't need to make threats.

328
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
My comrade brothers and sisters...

329
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,120
Huh! Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

330
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,360
I will conduct myself
as a businessman...

331
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,040
Who says "sweetheart"!

332
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,080
You say there is
a ten-shilling disparity

333
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,040
between male and female cutters
in two of my factories?

334
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,520
Very well.

335
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I will increase the pay of
the female cutters

336
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
in this factory by five shillings.

337
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
And I will cut the pay

338
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,240
of the male cutters in the Rover
by five shillings...

339
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,560
..thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

340
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,400
And I will tell the men
with families to feed

341
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,120
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

342
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,320
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

343
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Oh, yeah? The week after Christmas?
You think so?

344
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,760
You know, everything
you've said here today,

345
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,120
and the fact that we're having
this meeting today

346
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,520
tells me that you are
a woman without a family.

347
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,400
And everything I hear about you

348
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,760
tells me you are a man
without a family, as well.

349
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,400
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

350
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,520
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

351
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,400
as soon as Boxing Day.

352
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,160
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

353
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,400
I've heard lots of whistles blow,
sweetheart!

354
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,200
HE EXHALES

355
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,440
FOOTSTEPS

356
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
DOOR OPENS

357
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

358
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm sorry to keep asking,

359
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
but Chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

360
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,240
He's new. He's foreign.
He gets very upset.

361
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
Right. Well, you tell Chef

362
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,800
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

363
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,160
27? Family?

364
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,120
Yep. I thought Charlie
could do with some company,

365
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,200
so I asked Johnny Dogs if he knew
anyone who liked to eat goose...

366
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,920
..and he said he knew 26.

367
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,160
Tell Chef I want ten geese,

368
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,440
a buck cut into steaks,

369
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
some trout from the river.

370
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,880
Fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar. Best we have.

371
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
There will be children?

372
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Lots of children.

373
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,760
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor.

374
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,520
So have mops and buckets ready, eh?

375
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,240
And I want you at the table,
Frances, so make it 28.

376
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,320
I will be busy.

377
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
You've put up with me
this past year,

378
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,640
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business.

379
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,840
Tomorrow, you will eat at my table.

380
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,760
Things will get better, I think,
next year.

381
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,640
Uh-huh.

382
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,960
HE CLEARS THROAT

383
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
HE BREATHES HARD

384
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
It gets much warmer
than here in the summer.

385
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,680
- Much colder in the winter.
- I knew it.

386
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,800
But parts of it are
just like Birmingham.

387
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah. Shit and smoke
are the same everywhere.

388
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,240
Hm. What about you, Linda?
Are you working?

389
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,840
- I've been seeking work as a teacher.
- A teacher.

390
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,200
But, you know, it's quite difficult.

391
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
The Shelby name,
it's always in the papers.

392
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,720
And, er...what do you
get up to all day, Arthur?

393
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
As you know,
Arthur's previous endeavours

394
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,280
have left us with
no need for a salary.

395
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,240
Arthur occupies his time in
the garden, doing voluntary work.

396
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,880
He drives old people and cripples.

397
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh. Yeah, well,
it's something to do.

398
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,640
I want to open a garage.

399
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
- Some day.
- Fixing cars, you know?

400
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,960
Sometimes cars attract
ambitious men.

401
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,880
Yeah, well...I like fixing cars.

402
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,560
Mm.

403
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,200
PHONE RINGS

404
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,760
I'll go. I got it.

405
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Maypole 245.

406
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,560
Arthur, have you checked your post?

407
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
I just got served a black hand.

408
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,520
I just got delivered a black fucking
hand to the house.

409
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,400
From Luca Changretta.

410
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,800
WHISPERS: Jesus!

411
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Jesus Christ!

412
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,920
Wait a minute, John,
which one was Luca?

413
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
The old man's oldest son.

414
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,800
He was going to get done for
killing a bank clerk in a robbery,

415
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,760
so his old man sent him
back to New York.

416
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,640
You know what the black hand means
among the wops, Arthur?

417
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,600
It's Mafia shit.

418
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,360
The Sicilian fucking Mafia!

419
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Check your post, Arthur.

420
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
- Arthur, I was just leaving.
- No, you're not.

421
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,000
- I need...I need to talk to you.
- Arthur?

422
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's all right, Linda. Stay here.
Ada, please.

423
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
Linda? You stay here.

424
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Did you say Mafia?

425
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,520
- Esme, I need to make a call.
- No!

426
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,600
- I need to make a fucking call! Give it here!
- What the fuck is this?!

427
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
- Give it here!
- Not until you tell me what the fuck it is!

428
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,400
- Give it here!
- What is it?!

429
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,800
It's from Luca Changretta,
all right? We killed his dad.

430
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,200
I remember.
It was Tommy who killed him!

431
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
It was fucking Arthur
pulled the trigger!

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,800
All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur!

433
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,680
Anyway,
it makes no fucking difference!

434
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,960
For the wops, it's family.

435
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
The black hand came here.

436
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,280
Everybody will have got one.

437
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,160
They're coming for us all!

438
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
We made an agreement.

439
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,160
We made a solemn promise.

440
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,480
We're the family now.

441
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Here, look at that.

442
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,720
That's from Changretta's son, Luca.

443
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,440
How the fuck he
knows where I live. Eh?

444
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,840
And why's he waited a year?

445
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm going to see Tommy next.
I'll talk to him.

446
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,840
I've been served a black hand
and she won't even let me

447
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,600
keep a fucking
spud gun in the house.

448
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,200
Go to a hotel.

449
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
It's Christmas Eve, Ada.

450
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,600
I've got a gun in the glove
compartment. You take that for now.

451
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,480
I'll talk to Tommy
and have him call.

452
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,120
Just make sure you get to the
phone first. Yeah. Now hug me,

453
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,600
like you came out here
because you were emotional.

454
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,440
I am emotional. I just don't know
what fucking emotion it is.

455
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,160
It'll be OK. I'll talk to Tommy.

456
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,800
You talk to him.

457
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,040
GOOSE HONKS

458
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,800
You and me both, brother.

459
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,840
ENGINE STARTS

460
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Ada!

461
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,640
You wait there,
you won't leave empty handed.

462
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
Here you go, look, some eggs,

463
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,920
you give them to Polly, all right?

464
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,360
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

465
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,840
Take care.

466
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,640
Who was on the phone, Arthur?

467
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,640
John. Wishing me Merry Christmas.

468
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Come inside. It's getting late.

469
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,080
SHIP'S HORN

470
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,280
Thanks.

471
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,360
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

472
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Take off the hat.

473
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Are you with those other Italians?

474
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,040
We're Americans.
It says it right there on the paper.

475
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
USA.

476
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,480
And what's the purpose
of your visit?

477
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Pleasure.

478
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,320
Mum? It's me.

479
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,760
You left the door open.

480
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,040
To change the air.

481
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
I told you I was busy today.

482
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
What do you want?

483
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,440
Why haven't you opened your post?

484
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
I tidied up.

485
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Ada's coming today.

486
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
She's late.

487
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,320
Tommy asked about you today.

488
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

489
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Is Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

490
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,800
Yeah.

491
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,520
Bentleys are no good in the cold.

492
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,240
You should tell him.

493
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
I will.

494
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
Any other messages for Tommy?

495
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,960
Yeah. Fuck off.

496
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,200
He saw that your drain pipe
was broken. He was worried.

497
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Is that it? Is that all
he asked about? Drainpipes?

498
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,240
No. He said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

499
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,720
That you've always had a gift.

500
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,440
What gift?

501
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,200
Second sight.

502
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
Spirits. All that gypsy stuff,
he said that I'm to believe you.

503
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,560
You think I don't
hear his voice in yours.

504
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,800
You don't think
I recognise his strategies.

505
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm still a match for him.

506
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,680
Yes.

507
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,960
You are. And you still can be.

508
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Me and Lizzie decided that

509
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
this New Year
we're all to turn the page.

510
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,480
- You can't spend another year like this, Mum.
- "Mum."

511
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
Mum.

512
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
That word is like a bullet to me.

513
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,120
I see your sister in
that chair sometimes...

514
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,480
Look, me and Lizzie
have decided.

515
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
It's time.

516
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
I bought these.

517
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
One for you and Ada

518
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040
and one for you and me.

519
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,280
So Tommy said,
"Keep her off the whisky."

520
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
I'll drink Champagne
the day my son leaves

521
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,280
the employment
of Shelby Company Limited.

522
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,000
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

523
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,840
Right. Now, this is your job,
Charlie. We give those to Santa

524
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
and Rudolph.

525
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,520
Good boy. Put this out for Santa,
for his whisky.

526
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

527
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
- I will see you tomorrow. Sleep well.
- Come on, Charlie.

528
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,520
APPROACHING VEHICLE

529
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,360
KNOCKING

530
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,400
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

531
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
I know. Send her in.

532
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
I got a card, Ada.

533
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
I'm guessing Arthur
and John have had one as well.

534
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,080
Hello, Tommy. "Hello, Ada, welcome
home." Thanks, it's nice to be back.

535
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
I've spoken to Moss.

536
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,360
Moss said Changretta is a soldier
for the Spinetti family,

537
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,080
which means he will have men
with him, professional men.

538
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,720
They usually operate in
units of around ten.

539
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,040
Moss is checking Cunard records to
see if they're already in England.

540
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
This one's for you.

541
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
What is it? A time machine?

542
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,280
My God. Tommy Shelby.

543
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Is that regret?

544
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,360
I'll open it tomorrow.

545
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,760
So, boss, in the light of
the changed circumstances,

546
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
what are your orders?

547
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,840
Changretta knows where we all live.

548
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,520
If we stay out in the open, isolated,

549
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
he'll pick us off one by one.

550
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,840
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

551
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,800
You mean back home?

552
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,760
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

553
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

554
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm calling a family meeting.
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

555
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
Finn's already there.
You tell Polly and Michael.

556
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,920
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

557
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
And Esme and Linda?

558
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,280
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

559
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
needs to come to where it's safe.

560
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,800
These bastards
will kill kids as well.

561
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,560
When this business is finished,
we can...go our separate ways.

562
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
Go and see Polly and explain.

563
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,400
She'll have had a card as well.

564
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,560
Do you think I'm on the list?

565
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,080
We're all on the list, Ada.

566
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
I gave my gun to Arthur.

567
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,800
Welcome home.

568
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,800
Holy shit, it's Father Christmas.

569
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah, and if you're good...
you get what you deserve.

570
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,840
Fucking come here, you!

571
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,640
PHONE RINGS

572
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,760
Fuck.

573
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

574
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,640
PHONE RINGS

575
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
- Hello.
- <i>Arthur, it's Tommy.</i>

576
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
Be quick, they're asleep.

577
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,640
Family meeting,
Charlie's yard, Boxing Day, midday.

578
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,880
I can't raise John but
I'll send Michael to get him.

579
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,480
If you have to pull a gun on Linda,
do it. Merry Christmas.

580
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
Merry Christmas, Tom.

581
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,520
What did you do with them?

582
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,600
My tablets were in
the bathroom cabinet.

583
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
What did you do with them?

584
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,480
I threw them in the lavatory.

585
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,120
Tommy's orders?

586
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,280
No. My own decision.

587
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,240
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

588
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,560
They close everything.

589
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,680
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

590
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,600
- I'll help you.
- They don't open anything.

591
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Fucking no apothecary, nothing.

592
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,800
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

593
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,840
How can I get through
fucking Christmas? Without...

594
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,360
Without anything! How?

595
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,640
SHE BREATHES HARD AND RAPIDLY

596
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,320
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

597
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,200
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby!

598
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,680
Fuck off! It's all right it's me.
Mum, this as got to stop!

599
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,880
I don't want you,
I don't want you, Thomas Shelby.

600
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,440
My husband is back and he loves me.

601
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
Tommy said to believe in
spirits with you, but I can't.

602
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,960
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.
Merry Christmas.

603
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,480
The door was wide open.

604
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,800
Fuck.

605
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,080
I spent the whole day tidying up.
I wanted it to be nice.

606
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,640
I wanted it to look nice!

607
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,440
Why, Pol? It's only me.

608
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,680
It's OK. It's OK.

609
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,280
We can sit, sit and talk
and put things back together.

610
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,720
It's OK.

611
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,920
- I'll leave you two to it.
- No, you stay.

612
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,920
Now, listen, something's happened.
Things have changed.

613
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,560
Today everyone in the family
received one of these.

614
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,200
What does it mean?

615
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,800
Tommy's called a family meeting.
He wants you both to come.

616
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,160
APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

617
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,520
KNOCKING

618
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,200
Come.

619
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm really sorry to
bother you again, sir,

620
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,720
but Chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

621
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,560
Francis, for the last time,
it's Johnny Dogs. They're gypsies.

622
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,360
They're camped down by the river.

623
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,880
When they're ready
they'll walk up. All right?

624
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,400
He says it's about preparation, sir.

625
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,840
What is?

626
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,920
He's asked specifically.

627
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,160
Will they arrive before
the King's speech or after?

628
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
You said he was new, this chef.

629
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,080
When did he join us?

630
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,120
October.

631
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,720
October.

632
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,520
And he's foreign?

633
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,680
He's Italian, sir.

634
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,160
- Oh.
- He's the best chef we've ever had in the house.

635
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,000
No shouting or swearing
or blaspheming.

636
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,400
Do we have his references?

637
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,880
Yes.

638
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,720
The only problem
has been his assistant.

639
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,280
What assistant?

640
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,520
He brought an assistant with him.
He calls him his sous-chef.

641
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,320
Are they still working, Frances?

642
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,160
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

643
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,840
Right, thank you. Good night.

644
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,880
You can go to bed.

645
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,280
Merry Christmas, sir.

646
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,160
And I thought about your offer.

647
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,320
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

648
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
Right, thank you.

649
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,960
What's your name?

650
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,080
Max, Mr Shelby.

651
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,280
Max.

652
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,920
It's all right. Don't get up.

653
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,280
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, yes.

654
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,800
You're new. I'm Mr Shelby.

655
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,440
Hello, sir.

656
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,360
I haven't taken time to
introduce myself.

657
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,560
Antonio.

658
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,960
What have you done
that's so wrong, eh?

659
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Excuse me?

660
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,720
A sous-chef peeling potatoes.

661
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
It's an emergency. Late notice.

662
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
Oh. Late notice.

663
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,320
Right, right, carry on.

664
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,720
Antonio...

665
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,280
..here, £10.

666
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,680
For the late notice.

667
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,600
You wanted to know if
my guests would arrive

668
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
before or after the King's speech?

669
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,120
- Eh?
- Yes.

670
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,840
It'll be after.

671
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,720
How are you?

672
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,920
Oh, just...worried about tomorrow.

673
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah? I'm worried about Antonio.

674
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,040
You've been here two months
and we've not met before.

675
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,960
It's my fault. I've been busy.

676
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,680
Thomas Shelby.

677
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,200
My hand has blood.

678
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,640
Oh, mine too.

679
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,960
Hey, er, how much do you pay Antonio?

680
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,120
I forget.

681
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,520
Must be a lot.

682
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,680
I just gave him £10.

683
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,760
Didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

684
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,280
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

685
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,240
I've been reading up on you.

686
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,120
Bertorelli. Claridge's.

687
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,080
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's,

688
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,440
on...on Fleet Street.

689
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,760
I used to know the man
that owned San Marco's.

690
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,400
A man called Darby Sabini.

691
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,520
- I never met him.
- No.

692
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,920
Maybe your...assistant, Antonio,
maybe he's met him.

693
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,720
Here's how it is.

694
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,560
- Antonio was sent from New York.
- I don't know. Please...

695
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,000
Darby Sabini facilitated.

696
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,040
He passed him on to you and told
you to bring him into my house.

697
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,560
They threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

698
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,480
You want me to dress you like
you dressed that fucking stag?

699
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,120
Please!

700
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,480
- You know about me, right?
- Mm-hm.

701
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,040
- You know what I do?
- Mm-hm.

702
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,680
You wanted to know when
my guests would arrive

703
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,320
because Antonio needed me alone.
He's an assassin.

704
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,520
The plan is to kill me tomorrow.

705
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,120
I don't know.

706
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,040
They just said bring him here.

707
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, bring him here.

708
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,360
Antonio!

709
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,920
HE CALLS OUT IN ITALIAN

710
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,880
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

711
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,600
Aaaargh!

712
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,360
Aaaargh!

713
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,920
You are a black hand!
You are a black hand!

714
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,000
How many came from New York?
How many fucking came from New York?

715
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,560
Vaffanculo!

716
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,000
What did he... What did he say?
Is that a curse or a number?

717
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,680
What did he fucking say?
What did he fucking say?

718
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
- He said, "Fuck you."
- Yeah?

719
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,840
GUNSHOT

720
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,840
The black hand means
kill or be killed.

721
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,640
You go back to London,

722
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,480
you tell Darby Sabini he picked
the wrong side in this war.

723
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Once we've dealt with the Americans,
we'll come for him.

724
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,960
Go on, go.

725
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,120
Go.

726
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,760
Oi! You tell anyone else,
I'll come and find you.

727
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,040
Harrow 335.

728
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,720
The Hare and Hounds pub.

729
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,400
Robert. Yes, it's Mr Shelby.

730
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,280
Merry Christmas to you too.

731
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,760
Robert, is there a gypsy in
the public bar playing

732
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,760
the fiddle for shillings?

733
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,240
Yes.

734
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,600
Can you, er, can you tell him
I need to speak to him?

735
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,400
Thank you.

736
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,360
Oh, fuck, Tom.

737
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,360
I thought these sporting
days were over.

738
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,120
Yeah, so did I.
But they keep coming back at us.

739
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,760
There's a black stallion
in the stables.

740
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,000
He's invisible at night, use him.

741
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,440
Take the body across the river
to the rough ground.

742
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,600
- Burn him?
- No. This one's a message.

743
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,200
Will there still be
geese for dinner?

744
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,600
- Only if you can steal them on the way.
- On the way where?

745
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,440
We're going back, Johnny.

746
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,160
Back to Small Heath.

747
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,720
Back where you belong.

748
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,960
HE SPEAKS HIS OWN LANGUAGE

749
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,800
Merry Christmas.
You can keep the stallion.

750
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,640
Christ the fucking night.

751
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,360
Michael, they're coming today.
Michael, shut up and listen.

752
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,920
You've got to get everyone out.

753
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,200
Get Polly and Ada to Charlie's yard.

754
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,120
I've told Arthur
but I can't reach John.

755
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,920
When you've dropped Polly and Ada,

756
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,400
go out to John's place
and get him out. All right?

757
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,040
- Is it Christmas?
- Not just yet. Let's go, eh? - Mummy!

758
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,240
Move!

759
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,320
Hello?

760
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,040
GUN COCKS

761
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,040
Oh, fuck. It's you. Got nothing
better to do on Christmas morning?

762
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,360
Tommy wants everybody at
Charlie's yard now. Come on.

763
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,800
Get in. Get in. What's going to
happen? It's fucking Christmas.

764
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,680
Look, John, we don't
have time for this.

765
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,520
- Come into the house. - Just come to the meeting.
- Have some food.

766
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,280
Tell Tommy Shelby
we can look after ourselves.

767
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,320
Tommy says they could
come for us today.

768
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,400
Tommy says, Tommy says.
Are you his fucking parrot?

769
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,960
Look it's the Mafia, all right.

770
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,320
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

771
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,440
And we're the Peaky fucking Blinders.

772
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,720
No, we're not, John.

773
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,480
We're not the Peaky fucking Blinders
unless we're together.

774
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,880
You were together on the gallows,

775
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,480
with one man missing.

776
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,520
John? John, come to the meeting,
all right? Think about the kids.

777
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,280
Come to the meeting and
if you want to leave then fine.

778
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,840
HORSE HOOVES

779
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,120
No. It's Christmas Day.
We're the family now.

780
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,280
We're staying at home.

781
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,000
- In the fucking house!
- Esme...

782
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,640
John!

783
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,480
GUNFIRE
