ï»¿1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,913
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:04,809
All you have to do is sit with
Jack Nelson and talk about

3
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,329
a new golden age.

4
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,889
If anyone is going
to kill Tommy Shelby...

5
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:08,889
It will be you.

6
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:11,129
The future belongs to us.

7
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:13,329
Your daughter has Consumption.

8
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,329
Consumption is a very
infectious disease.

9
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:17,489
While they X-ray Ruby,
they have to X-ray us.

10
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,529
It'll be the girl's mother who laid
the curse.

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,649
Perhaps she waited until your little
girl was seven

12
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:22,929
so you'd know how it feels.

13
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,569
Now that I'm without whisky, I can
hear the spirits clearly

14
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:27,889
and they are saying Ruby will be
well if I make amends.

15
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,489
She's gone, Tommy.

16
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:21,726
Arthur.

17
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:25,998
I've written some words.

18
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:28,998
I can't speak 'em.

19
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:33,249
You're the oldest.

20
00:03:33,612 --> 00:03:35,509
You speak 'em for me.

21
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:47,712
I'm sorry, brother. I can't do it.

22
00:04:18,265 --> 00:04:20,505
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

23
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,972
She deserved a golden carriage.

24
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:34,186
But we didn't afford ourselves
that luxury.

25
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,292
Because gold doesn't work.

26
00:04:45,305 --> 00:04:47,745
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

27
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:08,139
This place was her favourite place
in the whole world.

28
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:10,169
And she used to say...

29
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:12,443
..."Dad...

30
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,843
..."you never know what's going to
come down the river."

31
00:05:19,843 --> 00:05:21,083
And it's true.

32
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:27,703
Little Ruby's fate came
a thousand miles too soon.

33
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:36,363
But in her name and in her memory
things will change.

34
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,449
And whatever comes down the river
from now on we will make good...

35
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,419
...we will make peaceful and honest
and good

36
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,739
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

37
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,483
In her memory we will do this.

38
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:09,563
But for now, we send her on,
to wherever it is you go...

39
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,643
...in the hope that if there
is a destination...

40
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,579
...that it's a yard like this,

41
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:22,503
with horses and boats for her
to play on.

42
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:38,179
Tom, I've got the petrol.

43
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,603
Who will light the flame?

44
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,323
Jeremiah?

45
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:58,179
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

46
00:06:58,203 --> 00:06:59,779
You light the flame.

47
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,899
- No, no! No!
- Lizzie...

48
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,339
No, you won't burn her! No!

49
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,699
Lizzie, shush, shush, shush!

50
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:13,099
I just want to see her.

51
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:14,890
- I just want to see her face.
- We'll go and see her together.

52
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,139
Come on.

53
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,379
- We'll go and see her together.
- Yeah.

54
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:31,379
Oh, my baby.

55
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,603
The devils who did this will pay, Ruby.

56
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,683
What do you mean?

57
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:04,143
What do you mean?

58
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,043
Where are you going?

59
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:32,723

60
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:02,663
Riley, I think the police are here.

61
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,163
Evadne Barwell?

62
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:10,379
Yeah. Who's asking?

63
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:13,523
I am here on behalf of
the blue sapphire.

64
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:26,259
Don't shoot! There are babies!

65
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:57,779
Gold dust.

66
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:01,419
Our business is done, Esme.
Get out of the car.

67
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,843
Not quite done, Tommy.

68
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:07,823
I thought this would be a good time.
In fact, it's the perfect time.

69
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:11,023
Some business is still unfinished.

70
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:16,379
Christians say, "The Lord gives,
the Lord takes away."

71
00:13:16,403 --> 00:13:18,419
Our spirits are the same.

72
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,659
Spirits just took away your child.

73
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,620
Get out of the car, Esme.

74
00:13:22,646 --> 00:13:25,619
But those same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

75
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:28,699
What child?

76
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:31,883
A daughter lost.

77
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:34,049
A son found.

78
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,539
Before you went to France,

79
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:41,899
a long time ago at Appleby Fair
you slept with a girl.

80
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:44,783
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

81
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:49,903
She said you slept together under
a hazel tree, May 1914.

82
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:55,859
When she fell pregnant, her father
threatened to kill you,

83
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,123
but you'd already joined the army
and gone away to France.

84
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:05,603
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don't you, Tommy.

85
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,382
Whoever that boy is, Esme...

86
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:15,028
...whoever he is,
our business is done here.

87
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,981
I brought you to this camp for a reason,

88
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,339
and I brought him as well.

89
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:20,923
He is yours.

90
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,619
A boy born with hazel eyes.

91
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:26,442
He calls himself Duke.

92
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:31,459
His mother is dead. He's a thief.

93
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:33,019
He works the fairgrounds, but he

94
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:36,123
says he wants more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

95
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,583
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

96
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,763
...I'll send him to you.

97
00:14:47,243 --> 00:14:49,143
If you give me a bit more gold...

98
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:54,059
...I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man far,

99
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,659
far more than big wheels and carousels.

100
00:14:59,003 --> 00:15:01,123
Is our business done or not, Tommy?

101
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,403
I know where you went.

102
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,379
I'm going to spend more hours
working in the Commons

103
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,779
with Mr Churchill.
His fight is my fight.

104
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:51,659
I sat like a stone and thought about
you killing someone in her name.

105
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,283
And the Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

106
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,739
I will set up a fund to research the
causes and cures for Consumption.

107
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,579
Did the woman you kill have children?

108
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,980
10,000 children die every year, Lizzie.

109
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,018
Go to bed, Tommy.

110
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,579
I've been reading about new research.

111
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:08,179
- Stop and close your fucking eyes.
- I will not...

112
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:09,819
I will not stop!

113
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,403
What is this good that you will become?

114
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:24,083
I killed a woman.

115
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:27,179
I killed a woman and three men.

116
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,699
And their bodies will be thrown
aboard the boat,

117
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,139
like all the other bodies,

118
00:16:31,163 --> 00:16:34,263
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

119
00:16:35,723 --> 00:16:37,003
Do you understand?

120
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:41,323
Yeah.

121
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:55,507
The doctor from the Sanatorium
called and said that he needs

122
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:57,443
to speak to you urgently.

123
00:16:59,283 --> 00:17:01,924
But I think now you are
beyond the help of doctors.

124
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:02,963
Lizzie...

125
00:17:06,016 --> 00:17:07,963
Frances said Arthur's here.

126
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:41,483
Tommy?

127
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,003
- Tom?
- Yeah, it's me.

128
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,643
Ah, fuck.

129
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,883
Arthur, give me a light, will you?

130
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,283
I can't find my lighter.

131
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,410
I'm sorry I couldn't speak at the
wagon, Tom.

132
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:37,843
Don't be sorry.

133
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:42,649
What are you doing here?

134
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,402
Waiting for this fucking cup to fill up.

135
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:54,123
Nearly empty, this barrel.

136
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,523
There are plenty of barrels, Arthur.

137
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,939
Start another barrel.

138
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,636
I thought maybe they're all full
of fucking blood.

139
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,243
The junk, Tom...

140
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,729
...fucks you up your mind.

141
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,569
You know, Arthur.

142
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,856
You was already fucked up.

143
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,003
You was fucked up since you were a kid.

144
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,363
This is my theory.

145
00:19:35,323 --> 00:19:37,059
It's from that time I gave you

146
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,563
a beating when you were 12
and I was nine.

147
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,943
We were fighting over cigarettes.

148
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:50,299
Maybe when I had you down on the ground,

149
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:53,419
I gave you one too many to the head.

150
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,219
It was a draw, though, Tom.

151
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:59,683
Nah, I beat you.

152
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:03,803
- I had you pinned.
- You actually didn't.

153
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,554
We both agreed.

154
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:09,803
You're so fucked,
you can't remember, brother.

155
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:15,139
I do. I do remember little things.

156
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,149
I know you do.

157
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:19,402
So, do I.

158
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,230
The fog and the gas is clearing, eh?

159
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,896
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

160
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,375
That's...

161
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:27,076
Tommy... stuff any more.

162
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,589
You don't drink no more, Tom.

163
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:57,529
After Polly was gone, Arthur...

164
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,643
...I thought I could just march
and march.

165
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,819
I just kept up that fucking left,

166
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:06,443
right, left, right, left, right,
fucking rhythm.

167
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,203
I'd never have to stop.

168
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,443
Then Ruby went.

169
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,942
I stumbled and crashed.

170
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,203
And now here I am...

171
00:22:27,923 --> 00:22:32,103
...sat on my arse on the ground

172
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:35,096
like a fucking tunneller..

173
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,283
...with my old comrade Arthur.

174
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,763
Remember the January, Arthur?

175
00:22:48,556 --> 00:22:49,796
The family boat?

176
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,179
The whole family living on something

177
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,483
the size of ten of these
fucking barrels.

178
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:03,459
Remember that night at Tile Cross,

179
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:07,203
16 of us sleeping on the boat,
the coppers come.

180
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,803
We all swam like rats.

181
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,539
Except for Arthur.

182
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,723
Arthur holds them off with
a boat hook, all on his own.

183
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:20,963
And I remember,

184
00:23:21,363 --> 00:23:23,939
I climbed back up at the lock
and looked back

185
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:27,059
and saw you waving that
fucking boat hook

186
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,580
in the copper's faces...

187
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:31,363
...on your own.

188
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,243
That's when I realised.

189
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:40,659
When I had you on the ground,
all them years ago,

190
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,110
it's because you let me win.

191
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,382
You wanted me to win.

192
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,283
You've wanted me to win ever since.

193
00:23:56,563 --> 00:24:03,203
What chance do I have... if you start
doing that again, eh?

194
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:06,823
You'll stop.

195
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:10,223
You'll stop cos the family needs you to.

196
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,463
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

197
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,259
You remember Dudley canal,
line number one?

198
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:22,219
3,172 yards of fucking
pitch blackness and rats swimming.

199
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,757
- Yeah.
- Then we'd come round that corner

200
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:28,683
and there'd be a shaft of light.
And then we'd know.

201
00:24:29,243 --> 00:24:30,187
Yeah.

202
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,203
And you and me would
both know it was nearly done.

203
00:24:35,923 --> 00:24:37,523
That's where we are now, Arthur.

204
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,523
Just a few more yards to go.

205
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:45,763
Then you'll change your ways.

206
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:51,563
And I'll change the fucking world.

207
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:11,579
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would've had dinner.

208
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,539
There are drinks and sandwiches,
if you want.

209
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,419
We're not here to eat.

210
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,539
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

211
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,859
Please, tell Mr Shelby on behalf of
us all

212
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,819
that changing the world can wait.

213
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,459
He doesn't want to wait.

214
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:24,979
There is Champagne.

215
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:26,323
Oh, goodie.

216
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,163
Charles?

217
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:42,043
I heard cars.

218
00:26:46,643 --> 00:26:47,979
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

219
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:49,203
I know.

220
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:54,283
Dad, there's a Bentley and a
Rolls-Royce.

221
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:58,283
Yeah.

222
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:01,803
Go to bed, Charles.

223
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,283
I can't sleep.

224
00:27:14,723 --> 00:27:16,563
I see her, when I shut my eyes.

225
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:19,883
Go to your mum.

226
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:21,943
She'll be awake.

227
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,299
She holds on to me.

228
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:25,843
Let her hold on to you.

229
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,603
You hear me?

230
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,643
Always let her hold on to you.

231
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,123
Go on.

232
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:40,659
Mr Shelby, the guests said they
would understand if...

233
00:27:40,683 --> 00:27:42,739
- Have you served them drinks?
- Yes.

234
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,003
Yeah.

235
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,043
OK, Frances.

236
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:05,123
The agenda is in my head.

237
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:08,443
The agenda is in my head.

238
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:10,683
I'm OK.

239
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,363
Do I look OK?

240
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,643
If someone touches you, you won't
shatter.

241
00:28:21,843 --> 00:28:23,303
Sing it.

242
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:25,899
Sing it. I love that song.

243
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:26,939
I...

244
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:30,339
...can't be singing rebel songs in
a house in grief and mourning.

245
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:32,179
Sing it to me softly.

246
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:33,663
It breaks my heart.

247
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,939
Don't look at him. He's English.

248
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:38,163
He can block his ears.

249
00:28:42,043 --> 00:28:46,699
Darling, should she sing her rebel
IRA song, while we wait

250
00:28:46,936 --> 00:28:48,816
or would that be inappropriate?

251
00:28:52,123 --> 00:28:55,383
You know I went to a meeting of
similar intent to this in Berlin.

252
00:28:55,923 --> 00:28:58,659
Attended by the Chancellor himself...

253
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,923
...and Goering and Himmler.

254
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:05,059
It lasted until the sun came up.

255
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:08,643
We spoke about the future of the
world in a serious way.

256
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:12,899
When the first rays of light entered
the room,

257
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,843
we all stood and stared at it, as if
it were the world to come.

258
00:29:17,443 --> 00:29:20,103
There was no singing, no giggling.

259
00:29:22,923 --> 00:29:24,974
And when breakfast was served on the
terrace,

260
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:26,699
overlooking the mountains,

261
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,403
they brought up some Jews.

262
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:33,083
And while we ate our eggs, they were
forced to eat grass.

263
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:38,243
And we watched as we sipped our coffee.

264
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:46,475
We should all remember this is
serious business.

265
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:57,243
Oh, Diana.

266
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:02,163
Now, look what you've done. You have
killed the mood.

267
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:10,723
Let her sing her fucking song to
raise our spirits. Go on, please.

268
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:25,139
âª In a neat little town
they call Belfast âª

269
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:28,859
âª Apprentice to trade I was bound âª

270
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:33,259
âª And many an hour's sweet happiness âª

271
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:37,219
âª Have I spent in
that neat little town âª

272
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:41,043
âª A sad misfortune came over me. âª

273
00:30:56,283 --> 00:31:02,203
âª Blackbird, sit on my shoulder
and tell me a song. âª

274
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:05,979
Did it break?

275
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:08,002
Mum will fix it for you.

276
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:25,763
She's not here any more.

277
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:41,379
âª Her eyes, they shone like diamonds âª

278
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:43,499
âª I thought her the Queen. âª

279
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,539
- Mr Shelby.
- No, please, no condolences.

280
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,250
Thank you all for coming.

281
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:50,939
Now, let's try to find out

282
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:53,323
how this new world of ours will
look, shall we?

283
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,699
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn to
what practical things

284
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:07,059
Mr Nelson can do to further our
cause, while he's in the country.

285
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,579
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

286
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:13,499
Which is kind of why I'm here, right?

287
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:17,623
We do, indeed, have things for you
to whisper into the President's ear.

288
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:21,019
Tell him we are England.

289
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,539
We are the mood England is in.

290
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:28,019
And in Ireland, appeasers to the
English abound

291
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:32,219
but we represent the true liberated
spirit of the country that...

292
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:33,903
...populated your own.

293
00:34:35,883 --> 00:34:38,739
I hear about communists in both places.

294
00:34:38,763 --> 00:34:41,063
We are the bulwark against them.

295
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,939
When it comes to the working class,

296
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:48,299
we could move our people from
Republicanism...

297
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:50,543
...to Fascism with just a nudge.

298
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:52,983
They trust us.

299
00:34:54,203 --> 00:34:56,859
You ride with hounds, Mr Mosley.

300
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,779
Will you hunt communists?

301
00:34:58,803 --> 00:35:01,619
Oh, my hounds are baying.

302
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,459
Shelby...

303
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:05,163
...you run as a socialist.

304
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,543
Mr Shelby has one of the largest
Commons majorities in England.

305
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,083
In the heart of England.

306
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:23,219
When the time comes, he'll resign
his party whip

307
00:35:23,243 --> 00:35:24,923
and run as an independent.

308
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,403
But underneath, do you truly believe
in the cause, Mr Shelby?

309
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:45,419
I'm here.

310
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,903
Mr Nelson, I'm here four nights...

311
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:56,483
Four nights after and I am here...

312
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:02,103
...in this room, in this meeting,
I am here and I am serious.

313
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,109
Prove it to him.

314
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:12,003
Prove it physically.

315
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,123
Perish Judah.

316
00:36:33,683 --> 00:36:35,043
Perish Judah.

317
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:44,063
That thing is going to get us killed.

318
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,403
Go to bed.

319
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:52,763
At school, they've stopped talking
to me.

320
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:58,603
They say the black rubs off.

321
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:05,083
When they come to power, they'll
take her off you.

322
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,363
They're going to separate us all out.

323
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:12,003
They'll send her to Africa.

324
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:15,443
Yeah?

325
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,996
And where will they send you?

326
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,843
Where will they send you, Karl?

327
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:24,779
You're half Gypsy, so...

328
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:26,203
...to Egypt maybe?

329
00:37:31,163 --> 00:37:33,979
Something I never told you before...

330
00:37:34,003 --> 00:37:35,763
...because it wasn't important.

331
00:37:37,363 --> 00:37:38,603
Maybe now, it is.

332
00:37:40,283 --> 00:37:41,963
Your dad was Jewish.

333
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:47,099
He was the son of a tailor in Stechford.

334
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:48,659
They changed their name to Thorne

335
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,003
to stop the bricks coming through
the window.

336
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,196
So, where will they send you, Karl?

337
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:01,579
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your President

338
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:04,979
that the aristocracy and the
meritocracy are united

339
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:08,043
in their conviction that a new order
is coming.

340
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:14,619
Also, Mr Nelson, at present our
weapons are coming from Germany.

341
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:17,059
The British are closing our supply
lines down.

342
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:19,203
We would value a supply from Boston.

343
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:24,299
Weapons, I can give you, if they're
to be used in a good cause.

344
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:27,299
And while on the subject of import
and export,

345
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:30,939
Mr Shelby, in light of our new
relationship,

346
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:33,099
and since you have proven your
commitment

347
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:35,539
in a most extraordinary way,

348
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,683
Boston is now officially open for
the importation of your merchandise.

349
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:47,243
Good.

350
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:31,179
If we have established what we came
here to establish,

351
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:32,979
perhaps we should all say goodnight.

352
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,363
Absolutely.

353
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:25,143
That's the same typewriter you
bought me all those years ago...

354
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,143
...to help me become respectable.

355
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:30,589
Do you remember?

356
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,363
Yeah.

357
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:42,003
This arrived.

358
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:44,483
It's from the sanatorium.

359
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:48,463
I've already paid Ruby's medical bills.

360
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,259
I don't think it's a bill.

361
00:40:51,283 --> 00:40:54,143
It says it's urgent. It's from the
senior consultant.

362
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:15,023
Why didn't you come to bed?

363
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,243
Why didn't you come to bed?

364
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:30,322
I'm typing up my recollection of the
meeting.

365
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:36,763
If I... if I do it straight away, I
can quote people word for word.

366
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,499
The information is more...

367
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:43,223
...useful to Mr Churchill if it is
word for word.

368
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,129
I burnt her chair.

369
00:42:14,443 --> 00:42:17,699
The paint on the wood left a smell
in the air.

370
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,743
I didn't open the window.

371
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:23,763
I quite like the smell.

372
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:51,083
Not yet.

373
00:42:53,723 --> 00:42:55,123
Not yet.

374
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:00,699
I have this work to do cos now I know...

375
00:43:00,723 --> 00:43:02,123
...that I will change.

376
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:05,843
That I have to change.

377
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:10,563
And change for good, Lizzie.

378
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:17,163
Not just yet.

379
00:43:48,883 --> 00:43:50,003
Hello?

380
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:55,643
Oh.

381
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:11,823
I saw him leave.

382
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:16,843
He keeps this apartment expressly
for this purpose, doesn't he?

383
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,023
Are you following me, Mr Shelby?

384
00:45:21,923 --> 00:45:23,819
I'm flattered...

385
00:45:23,843 --> 00:45:25,263
...but why?

386
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,419
When I do business with someone,

387
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:30,203
I make it my business to know their
secrets.

388
00:45:33,016 --> 00:45:35,056
Mosley's reputation is no secret.

389
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,062
Not him, you.

390
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,303
How did you know I'd come here?

391
00:45:42,763 --> 00:45:44,563
I know things.

392
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:47,483
I read people's minds, you know.

393
00:45:50,163 --> 00:45:53,459
Little glances across tables. It's a
gift.

394
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,203
The whole family...

395
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,688
...witches and sorcerers.

396
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:08,429
Your uncle will disown you.

397
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:12,763
Fucking his business partner behind
his back.

398
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:15,459
You think he has morals?

399
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:16,739
He's a Catholic.

400
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:19,503
Men do what they want, women do what
they are told.

401
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:22,803
Will you tell Michael?

402
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,403
Michael is family.

403
00:46:26,996 --> 00:46:28,516
We are a family healed.

404
00:46:30,323 --> 00:46:32,419
You have no interest in me...

405
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,862
...or in Michael.

406
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:38,243
So, why don't you just tell me what
you actually want?

407
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:52,979
You will be with Mosley...

408
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:54,549
...when he's in Berlin.

409
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,699
You'll be in the room,

410
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,539
when he meets senior members of the
German Government.

411
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,883
I want to know what is discussed...

412
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:04,763
...and I want to know what is decided.

413
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:08,523
And if I lie?

414
00:47:10,843 --> 00:47:12,283
I will know.

415
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,503
You know Michael thinks you're the
devil...

416
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,189
...and I think he might actually be
right.

417
00:47:28,843 --> 00:47:30,983
That was the other reason I came here.

418
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:35,299
What are Michael's real intentions
toward me, Gina?

419
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,343
And if you lie, I will know.

420
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:43,809
Tommy...

421
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:47,423
...he intends to complete the deal.

422
00:47:48,563 --> 00:47:50,163
And then, you both walk away.

423
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:06,003
Fuck.

424
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:29,363
Come.

425
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:33,603
Mr Shelby, Doctor Holford.

426
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,923
Send him in.

427
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,499
You said it had to be in person.

428
00:49:47,689 --> 00:49:48,929
Here I am.

429
00:49:50,643 --> 00:49:52,443
You might want to sit down.

430
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:02,983
Mr Shelby, I know that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

431
00:50:04,403 --> 00:50:06,483
...but I have news that cannot wait.

432
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:16,703
When you were X-rayed and examined
at the sanatorium ten days ago...

433
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:21,963
...there was no TB found in your lung.

434
00:50:24,003 --> 00:50:27,099
But I am afraid they found something
else.

435
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:29,743
Something related to your daughter's
illness.

436
00:50:33,403 --> 00:50:36,419
They tried to speak to you at the
hospital

437
00:50:36,443 --> 00:50:38,083
but you were not co-operating.

438
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,523
After your daughter's death,

439
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:45,743
you could not be found to be
informed in person.

440
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:49,743
Eventually, as your personal doctor,
they called me.

441
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,843
I didn't offer you tea. You look
like death. Do you want tea?

442
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:58,843
No.

443
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:03,463
At the sanatorium, they conducted
blood tests.

444
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:09,019
The tests suggest that the shadow
you can see

445
00:51:09,043 --> 00:51:11,179
at the base of your skull...

446
00:51:11,203 --> 00:51:12,803
...is not cancer.

447
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:15,563
It is tuberculoma.

448
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:21,843
A tubercular growth caused by the
same bacteria as TB.

449
00:51:25,203 --> 00:51:27,443
You may have picked it up from your
daughter.

450
00:51:29,243 --> 00:51:33,419
Once this disease enters a
household, it can run wild.

451
00:51:33,443 --> 00:51:36,243
It can be transmitted with a simple
kiss.

452
00:51:40,203 --> 00:51:42,803
It seems the Shelby household is no
exception.

453
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:51,123
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware that
you are still grieving...

454
00:51:52,323 --> 00:51:55,023
...but you must understand this is
very serious.

455
00:51:57,003 --> 00:52:00,483
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must've been rapid.

456
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:05,443
I have no doubt that you are already
experiencing symptoms?

457
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,123
Have you recently suffered seizures?

458
00:52:10,523 --> 00:52:16,463
Bouts of weakness, dissociation,
hallucinations?

459
00:52:24,123 --> 00:52:25,883
Why didn't you come and see me?

460
00:52:28,443 --> 00:52:29,923
I have work to do.

461
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:35,083
Am I a danger to others?

462
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:38,163
No.

463
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:42,179
Unlike TB, tuberculoma is not
infectious.

464
00:52:42,383 --> 00:52:46,339
Mr Shelby, it is not infectious...

465
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,143
...but in your case...

466
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,843
...I am afraid it is inoperable.

467
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:54,579
The growth is in your brain stem.

468
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:55,979
Any attempt to remove it

469
00:52:56,003 --> 00:52:58,743
would result in trauma and brain
haemorrhage.

470
00:53:03,163 --> 00:53:04,979
Whilst you were refusing my calls,

471
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:08,363
I showed your X-rays to three of
the best surgeons in the country.

472
00:53:12,283 --> 00:53:14,343
They all said they would not operate...

473
00:53:15,523 --> 00:53:16,883
...as it would be futile.

474
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:22,843
Of course, you will want a second
opinion for yourself.

475
00:53:24,043 --> 00:53:27,219
Doctor Helen Rutherford at St Thomas'.

476
00:53:27,243 --> 00:53:28,563
She is a friend.

477
00:53:39,843 --> 00:53:41,283
This...

478
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:44,483
How bad will it get?

479
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:53,099
As the tumour grows,

480
00:53:53,256 --> 00:53:57,096
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

481
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:06,299
Eventually, you will need people
around you constantly,

482
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:08,043
who love you very much.

483
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:12,749
How long?

484
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:19,743
I understand you have defeated many
enemies, Mr Shelby.

485
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:22,979
Now, you have a new one...

486
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:24,283
...inside you.

487
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,203
You cannot defeat it...

488
00:54:28,643 --> 00:54:30,843
...but you can keep it at bay for a
while.

489
00:54:31,363 --> 00:54:35,579
If you live correctly, if you are
determined and if you fight...

490
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:37,539
I asked you a question.

491
00:54:37,563 --> 00:54:39,179
So, I want an answer.

492
00:54:39,203 --> 00:54:42,019
I don't want your fucking platitudes.

493
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:46,783
How long before I need people around
me, who love me very much?

494
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:53,299
- Sorry.
- It's fine, Lizzie.

495
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,383
My accountant here was just leaving.

496
00:55:00,883 --> 00:55:03,379
I will telephone you, when I get
back to London.

497
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,859
No, I don't have enough time.

498
00:55:04,883 --> 00:55:07,563
You're an accountant, give me a
fucking number now.

499
00:55:08,883 --> 00:55:10,463
One year.

500
00:55:11,403 --> 00:55:13,619
Perhaps 18 months.

501
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,139
That's fine. That's all I need to know.

502
00:55:16,163 --> 00:55:19,443
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

503
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:23,268
I will write to you,
explaining the full implications.

504
00:55:23,292 --> 00:55:25,163
Yeah, thank you.

505
00:55:29,229 --> 00:55:30,909
Good day.

506
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:40,863
Something serious?

507
00:55:41,483 --> 00:55:43,699
No, no, just a...

508
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:47,899
...just a bill I wasn't expecting and
I...

509
00:55:47,923 --> 00:55:49,523
I'll have to pay it.

510
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:01,523
Will you give me a minute on my own,
Lizzie?

511
00:56:05,543 --> 00:56:06,903
Yeah.

512
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,763
Not a devil...

513
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:28,763
...just an ordinary mortal man.

514
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:37,563
There will be a war in this family...

515
00:56:39,803 --> 00:56:41,643
...and one of you will die.

516
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:45,563
Polly.

517
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,963
Just give me enough time to do what
I have to do.

518
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:53,539
Kill.

519
00:56:53,563 --> 00:56:55,323
Kill.
