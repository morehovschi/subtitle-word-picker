3
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:03,228
Hi, Frankie.

4
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:05,103
Hello.

5
00:02:14,436 --> 00:02:15,728
Get in there.

6
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:41,103
Nothing like that first
drink of the day.

7
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,478
Go on, drink up. Enjoy.

8
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,103
Hey, what's he doing, huh?

9
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,519
Hey, they tell me you're
some dancer.

10
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:49,728
Well, how about a little
dance anyway?

11
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,228
No?

12
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,478
Come on!

13
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:18,061
Hey! Gimme back.

14
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:21,228
Don't horse around. What's
the big idea?!

15
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,644
Frankie!

16
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:24,561
Frankie!

17
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:26,144
Frankie, when'd you get back?

18
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,436
How are ya'?

19
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:29,311
You all right?

20
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,311
Y'know?

21
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,311
The monkey's gone.

22
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:33,978
Lemme look at ya.

23
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,478
Lemme look at ya!

24
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,603
Nah! Not even a posty-card!

25
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,603
You can't read, anyway.

26
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:43,061
Well, you could have drawed pictures?

27
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,728
Ah, YOU goofy punk.

28
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,186
How's the lost dog business?

29
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:46,728
Aach!

30
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:50,478
Soon as they see me hanging around,
people start lockin' up their mutts.

31
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:54,394
I tell ya, folks just don't have that trust
in their fellow man any more.

32
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:55,103
Y'know what I mean?

33
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,019
Hey, Antek?

34
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,228
- Look who's out.
- Frankie!

35
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,144
You all right?

36
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,561
- Clean?
- Yep.

37
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:04,228
Good kid.

38
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:05,853
Enough, already. Buy me a drink.

39
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:06,436
Sure.

40
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,436
Hey, look what the cat
dragged in.

41
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:09,936
Frankie, honey!

42
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,769
You were gone so long I thought
maybe you was made warden!

43
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:14,228
Hey, you're looking good, y'know?

44
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,228
Put on six pounds.

45
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,644
Wow! Six pounds.

46
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:19,186
He's gone so long I thought
maybe he's made warden.

47
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,561
How was it down there, Frankie?

48
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,103
Greatest place you ever see, Vangie.

49
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:23,228
She means Lexington.

50
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,144
I'm tellin' ya.

51
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:26,519
Ball games, great food.

52
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:28,061
I even learned how to play the drums.

53
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:31,228
You make it sound as if I missed something,
by not going to jail years ago.

54
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:32,561
It's a prison, no?

55
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:34,061
More a hospital, kinda.

56
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:35,394
Lemme show ya somethin'.

57
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:37,394
Ah, federal pens is always best.

58
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,603
Ask anybody.

59
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:39,644
Oh, I know.

60
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:42,228
He's gone so long, I think
he's made warden.

61
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,728
Ever see anything so pretty?

62
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:47,603
Don't touch!

63
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,186
Hey, how'd ya sneak 'em out, Frankie?

64
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:51,019
The guys give me 'em,
up there in the band.

65
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:52,519
They let you have a band?

66
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:53,603
Yeah, I was in it.

67
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,394
And they chipped in and bought
me these when I left.

68
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:56,311
Wow!

69
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,394
Long time, Dealer.

70
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:01,686
How was it there? Bad, huh?

71
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:05,644
It was all right.

72
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:07,394
Six months.

73
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,061
You can hardly wait, I bet.

74
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,311
Come over my place.

75
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:14,228
Come on.

76
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:16,769
No thanks, Louie.

77
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:17,728
You broke?

78
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,353
Now, ain't you being stupid.
It's for free!

79
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:21,978
I don't need it, is all.

80
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:23,561
I kicked it.

81
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:25,561
Oh!

82
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:27,436
Kicked it.

83
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:29,978
One of "them".

84
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,311
- I mean it.
- Sure!

85
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,186
I'll be around.

86
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:44,353
Frankie, don't do it.

87
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,811
Don't start up with that
peddler again.

88
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:47,436
Me?

89
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,728
I'd rather chop my arm off
before I let him touch it.

90
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,436
This Dr Lennox, that took care of me down
at the hospital - a real good guy.

91
00:05:55,644 --> 00:05:57,311
He told me at least ten times, he said...

92
00:05:57,436 --> 00:06:00,394
"Frankie, when you get out of here
you take even one fix..."

93
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,936
"...you're hooked again."

94
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,894
Don't worry about me, buddy boy.

95
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:09,186
Let's get outta here.

96
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:10,228
Thanks, Antek.

97
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,228
Antek - take care of this asset for me?

98
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,353
I got a customer comin' to get it.

99
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:16,769
Okay, Sparrow.

100
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,686
Aw, let him give you no gas.

101
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:25,769
Him? Huh.

102
00:06:26,144 --> 00:06:28,478
I ain't gonna be around here long
enough to let him bother me.

103
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:31,394
I'm gonna get me a job in
a big-name band.

104
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,394
You're kiddin'.

105
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:35,853
What do you think I'm strengthenin'
my wrist for, buddy-o?

106
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,436
Guy teaches me drummin' down there
says that I'm a natural.

107
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:39,644
"Can't miss", he says.

108
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:41,144
"Arms made of pure gold".

109
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:43,436
You mean a job wanging
these drums?

110
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,019
I got everything planned, too.

111
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:47,019
Gonna call myself...

112
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:48,769
"Jack Duval".

113
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:52,478
Prolly I ain't gonna see you
around so much then, huh?

114
00:06:52,603 --> 00:06:54,478
Ah, maybe I can set somethin'
up for you.

115
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,019
Carrying the instruments or somethin'.

116
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:56,936
Wow!!

117
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:59,686
Travellin' around the country.
High-type night clubs.

118
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:00,853
How's that sound to ya, punk?

119
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,144
When is it gonna be? When?

120
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:02,978
Right away. Today.

121
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,686
Hey, I'm the kinda guy... boy, when
I move - watch my smoke.

122
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,478
But I'm gonna need some
good clothes, though.

123
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:10,311
Ah, well. You go on up. I'm
gonna find you some.

124
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,519
Yeah. yeah. Size thirty-nine, get.

125
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,561
- Thirty nine.
- Stripes.

126
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:14,978
- Stripes.
- Somethin' nice.

127
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:25,728
You stop that noise!

128
00:07:25,853 --> 00:07:26,978
You and husband...

129
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:28,769
...or I throw you both out!

130
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,644
You hear?

131
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,811
I'll make all the noise I want.

132
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,811
Who is landlord? Me!

133
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:35,394
You do like I say!

134
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,936
Your mother's icebox, I
do like you say!

135
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,519
Frankie Machine!

136
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:45,353
Aw, ya look great!

137
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:48,353
How ya feelin', Frankie? Uh, I mean---

138
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,353
Fine, fine. Just fine.

139
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,769
- Hi, landlord.
- Mad!

140
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:53,811
She and husband, fight all the time.

141
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,811
Holler! Throw things!

142
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:57,061
Nothin' changes!

143
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,353
This is respectable house, and
I am respectable man.

144
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:04,644
Respectable, my eye. Go on and get out -
you're late for the parole board.

145
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,811
Frankie?

146
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,436
Oh, Frankie!

147
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:35,561
Oh, Frankie!

148
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:37,561
You're home!

149
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:38,436
Oh!

150
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,186
Oh, Frankie. I love you so much.

151
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:44,061
Oh!

152
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:49,144
Oh, Frankie - I've missed you so.

153
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,144
You don't know how much
I've missed you.

154
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,686
I've been so lonely Frankie,
without you.

155
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:00,228
Sshh!

156
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,769
So lonely. Lonely.

157
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:04,144
Zosch. Don't cry, Zosch.

158
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,644
Lemme look at you.

159
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,103
My eyes are going to be all red.

160
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:11,269
Nah. You look fine, Zosch.

161
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:11,853
Honest?

162
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,311
Has the cold sore gone?

163
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,936
Ah, ya look real good.

164
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:25,311
I had this cold sore.

165
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,436
I wanted to look real nice for you,
when you came back.

166
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,978
I was afraid it wouldn't be gone...

167
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,811
...so I put this goofy salve
on it to dry it.

168
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,269
Oh, Frankie.

169
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,144
Oh, Zosch.

170
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,228
Everything's gonna be all right.

171
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,061
Oh, you didn't see. Look!

172
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:45,061
Vi got the cake by the bakery.

173
00:09:45,478 --> 00:09:47,061
But the sign, I made.

174
00:09:47,144 --> 00:09:49,478
It's sorta like for a
welcome home.

175
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,894
Gee, it's like a real party
or somethin'.

176
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,478
Real nice, Zosch.

177
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:01,186
How are you, Frankie?

178
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,769
- I'm clean.
- Sure?

179
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,728
I kicked it, for keeps.

180
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:08,728
Did it hurt?

181
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,311
How was it there for you?

182
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,311
Oh, they treated me fine,
down there.

183
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:17,186
There was this doctor - this Dr Lennox.
He was real good to me.

184
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,061
Frankie.

185
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,394
Frankie.

186
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,394
Did you miss me?

187
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:26,561
Of course I missed you, Zosch.

188
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:28,561
What kind of silly question is that?

189
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,644
Of course I missed you.

190
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:33,644
Honest, no kiddin'.

191
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,561
- What you got there?
- You'll see.

192
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:39,978
Oh - I brought you somethin'.

193
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:46,103
Oh... oh, it's an exquisite thing.

194
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:48,103
You like it? I made it myself.

195
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:49,478
Out of cigarette wrappers.

196
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:52,061
Oh, it's just an exquisite thing, is all.

197
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:54,144
- You made it?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,353
For a hobby, like.

199
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:57,478
See, part of the cure...

200
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,603
...is to keep yourself busy, doin'
things you enjoy.

201
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,519
Like for instance I wanted to learn
to drum, and music.

202
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:06,478
And Dr Lennox got 'em
to help me do it.

203
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:10,978
During the day I was kept busy enough,
but sometimes at night...

204
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:13,769
...I'd get restless and I'd want to keep
my mind off the craving.

205
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,519
I made that.

206
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,353
There's something important
I gotta tell you.

207
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,019
What?

208
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:22,353
I forget right now.

209
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,269
A whistle?

210
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,394
Oh. I was scared sometimes,
being alone.

211
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:32,019
So Vi got it for me, I should blow for
her when I wanted her.

212
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,853
Go on - you were telling me.

213
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,853
Oh, well.

214
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,936
The first thing you do when you get there, you
talk to a doctor for about two hours---

215
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:42,728
Wild! I know what it is. I know
what I had to tell ya.

216
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:44,144
Vi took me to this movie...

217
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,061
...and the girl's kid brother
had a friend in it.

218
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,228
Now who do you think he looked like?

219
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,728
- Who?
- You!

220
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:51,894
That was a good movie.

221
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,894
Stage show was real good, too.

222
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:56,686
We owe Vi eighty cents for
the movie, I was broke.

223
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,686
And we owe her for the cake, too.

224
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,478
How come you didn't have any money?

225
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,853
Schwiefka didn't kick in regular?

226
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:04,478
No.

227
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,478
Well, he was supposed to!

228
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:10,894
It was his joint they raided, not
mine. I was just a dealer.

229
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,478
I kept my mouth shut and
took the rap!

230
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:19,061
If he didn't send fifty a month
regular, how much did he?

231
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:21,061
Well, he sent fifty, but
not regular.

232
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:23,519
You see, Vi had to kick in
for me, sometimes.

233
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:28,561
She took good care of ya?

234
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:30,228
Did you have fun with her?

235
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:31,311
Yeah.

236
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:33,936
But not like, when you're here.

237
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,603
It was terrible being
alone, Frankie.

238
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:39,186
And my legs, when they hurt...

239
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:42,061
...she don't massage like you,
when they hurt.

240
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,644
What did they say by the
clinic, Zosch?

241
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:49,769
I stopped going by that
goofy clinic.

242
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,769
The clinic must know what's
right, Zosch.

243
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,478
You gotta start the clinic again.
You gotta get well.

244
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:58,061
Vi dreamed that this new doctor round
the corner, he cured me.

245
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:01,144
I'd have gone to him already, but
he ain't free like the clinic.

246
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:04,978
But now you're back, makin' money
again by Schwiefka, I'll go.

247
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:07,644
I've finished with Schwiefka.

248
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,353
I don't deal for him no more.

249
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:11,103
But you always deal!

250
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:14,019
You're a dealer. You're the best
dealer in the business.

251
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,311
No more. I'm a drummer now.

252
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,811
Don't make jokes, Frankie.

253
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:22,519
I never know when you're
making jokes.

254
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:24,936
Who's jokin', Zosch? Listen.

255
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,853
Nice, huh?

256
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:36,769
This Dr Lennox, I told him
my whole life story.

257
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:39,061
From when I was born, almost.

258
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,686
And about you and me.

259
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,936
But he told me that if I lived
when I got out...

260
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,728
...like I lived before I went in there...

261
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:48,228
...chances are I would be hooked
again in no time.

262
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:52,186
So that's why I want to
get with a band.

263
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:54,186
Listen.

264
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:00,769
How's that?

265
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,894
Cute.

266
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,936
What you tell him about
me, this doctor?

267
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:08,353
I told him about...

268
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,019
...gettin' some money and
gettin' you well.

269
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,436
And he said gettin' with a band
was a good way to go at it.

270
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,478
He even gave me the name of a guy
in town, right here, to get a job.

271
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:19,644
That's nice.

272
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:22,561
I mean if this man with a job ever
heard of this great doctor.

273
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:25,144
Most times these things just
don't come through.

274
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:27,853
I got this.

275
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:31,186
- What is it?
- It's a letter from the doc.

276
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:33,478
I think I'll go call him now.

277
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:36,311
Now? Let's talk about it tomorrow.

278
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,853
I'll be right up, Zosch.

279
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:39,853
You ain't even tasted
the cake!

280
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:41,769
But I'll only be a minute.
I'll be right up.

281
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,769
No, now, Frankie!

282
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:48,811
First...

283
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,644
...taste a piece of nice...

284
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:53,978
.“cake.

285
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:01,936
Hey, ya comin', baby?

286
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,936
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin', Johnny.

287
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:13,228
- Hey, Molly.
- Yeah, I'm comin', Johnny.

288
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,811
I want to talk to Mr Harry Lane, please.

289
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:22,936
- How 'bout it, huh?
- Machine.

290
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:23,978
Frankie Machine.

291
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,978
Yeah, I got a letter of
introduction for him.

292
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,103
From Dr Lennox.

293
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:28,436
Yeah.

294
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:30,603
Hello, Frankie.

295
00:15:32,353 --> 00:15:33,644
Dr Martin Lennox.

296
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,353
How ya been, Molly?

297
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,228
All right.

298
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,978
Come on, baby, let's go.

299
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:40,311
- Yeah - I'm comin', Johnny.
- Yeah.

300
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,519
A guy I met, when you was away.

301
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,769
Mr Lane?

302
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:47,769
I got a letter for ya, yeah.

303
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,478
Come on, what d'ya say, kitten?

304
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,519
This afternoon, huh?

305
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,186
Would you? I sure do appreciate
it, Mr Lane.

306
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,061
Thank you so much.

307
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:57,144
Okay. Goodbye.

308
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:00,311
Frankie!

309
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,978
A new thing by Brach's
Department Store.

310
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,561
No sales girls!

311
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,103
It's just help yourself.

312
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,811
It's what they call a
"honour system".

313
00:16:09,728 --> 00:16:10,811
What'sa matter, Frankie?

314
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:12,811
Feel that material!

315
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:13,894
An' I figured...

316
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,644
...as long as I'm there ---

317
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,394
Nice, huh?

318
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,353
You all right?

319
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,353
Frankie?

320
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,603
I got the drumming job.

321
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:26,144
Already? Wow!

322
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,144
When I move, I move like
a streak, punk.

323
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,603
Think it looks all right, Zosch?

324
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,978
How come ya ask me,
all of a sudden?

325
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:43,853
I just wanna know if it looks
all right, Zosch.

326
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,561
And my name ain't Zosch.
It's Sophia.

327
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,853
What's the matter?

328
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:52,186
Nothing's the matter.

329
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:55,144
'Cept how would you feel, if
your spine was hurtin'?

330
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,019
Well, why didn't you say so?

331
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,769
On account it's your first
day back, I...

332
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,769
...I just didn't want you
should worry.

333
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:06,519
Don't be like that, Zosch.
Is it bad?

334
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:09,811
Well, maybe the new doctor'd do
me some good, huh?

335
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,186
We'll go see him when
I get back.

336
00:17:12,728 --> 00:17:14,186
Take me now, Frankie.

337
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:18,103
Zosch, you--- I got this appointment. You
know how much it means to me.

338
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,103
We'll go as soon as I get back.

339
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:21,728
Please.

340
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,061
- Frankie!
- I'll hurry. I'll hurry.

341
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,478
Frankie! Well---

342
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,394
Gimme a little more massage
then first, huh?

343
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:28,561
Zosch.

344
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:32,436
I'm doin' this for you. To get some money,
so you can get a good doctor.

345
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:33,811
Aw, please Frankie?

346
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:35,811
Look, I'll get ya a dog, too.
How's that, huh?

347
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:36,728
Get her a dog, will ya?

348
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:38,894
I'll give the matter my
personal attention.

349
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:41,311
Just have confidence in
the management.

350
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,561
Wish me luck, Zosch?

351
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,603
Oh...

352
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:50,436
Frankie!

353
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:52,894
Oh, Frankie?

354
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:54,519
Wait!

355
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,103
Wait, Frankie!

356
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:31,394
Can't be two places at once.
What could I do?

357
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,103
Yeah, she just don't realise.

358
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:34,228
Aw, shut up, punk!

359
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:35,311
"Just don't realise."

360
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,019
How would you like to
be nailed to a chair?

361
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:47,811
Frankie, Frankie. How are ya?

362
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:48,728
Antek!

363
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:52,144
Well, it didn't do you no harm.
Did it, Frankie?

364
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:54,519
Ooh, you look good.

365
00:18:54,644 --> 00:18:57,186
That's right, Schwiefka, it was
a real country club.

366
00:18:57,644 --> 00:18:58,311
Hmm.

367
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,853
They give you this when
they let you out?

368
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:03,603
Give him nothin'. I bought
it by Brach's.

369
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:05,894
You know, I come as soon
as I hear you're out.

370
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,394
I figured he's worried about
getting his job again.

371
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,811
Tell him "don't worry".

372
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,811
Schwiefka don't forget so quick.

373
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:13,228
Job's waitin'.

374
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,103
You need a dealer, you say'?

375
00:19:15,228 --> 00:19:16,769
Need? No!

376
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:20,103
I been dealin' myself, and man, I built
up a game like nobody's business.

377
00:19:20,103 --> 00:19:21,228
I got a great followin'.

378
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,686
The play is bigger than ever.

379
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:24,436
I hear you wasn't doin' so good.

380
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:25,853
From who?

381
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:27,853
When I say "great", I don't
mean a lot.

382
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,728
A few, but loaded.

383
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,103
So, what do you want me for?

384
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:32,603
Like I'm tellin' ya...

385
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,394
...I take care of my friends.

386
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:37,186
Can I polish your halo, Schwiefka?
Only a quarter!

387
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,603
Knock it off, punk.

388
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:39,853
Look.

389
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,311
I've been doin' all right...

390
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,353
but I don't say that the customers like
me better than they like you.

391
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:45,936
The dealer makes the house.

392
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:46,936
I know that.

393
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,603
Whaddaya Say?

394
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:50,103
No.

395
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:52,103
Ya dealin' for some other joint?

396
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:53,603
I ain't dealin' for nobody.

397
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:55,853
I ain't dealin' for nobody, no more.

398
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,144
Is that the way ya repay me?

399
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:00,144
Didn't I send money to Zosch?

400
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:03,144
Eh, I've gone and told all my friends that you're
gonna be workin' for me again.

401
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,728
What am I supposed to do?

402
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,894
Far as I'm concerned you can go back
to matchin' pennies with school kids.

403
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:08,603
Why, you---

404
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:10,978
Hey, Antek!

405
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:12,978
Antek!

406
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:16,269
Who is he?

407
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:18,478
Drunky?

408
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:19,936
His name's Johnny somethin'.

409
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,186
He's house-man for Gubachek's
Pool Room.

410
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,728
Is that a thing with him?

411
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:26,978
They see each other.
You wanna meet him?

412
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:27,728
Naw.

413
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,728
So long, Antek.

414
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,686
See ya, Frankie.

415
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:35,978
Hey, you!

416
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,186
Get in, Dealer.

417
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,186
Who, me? What for?

418
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,561
You too, punk.

419
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:45,853
I didn't do nothin'.

420
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:47,853
Now, wait a minute, Kvorka. Listen!

421
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:49,978
I'm on my way to get a job.
It's important to me!

422
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:50,478
Get.

423
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,478
You can pick me up
some other time!

424
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,019
I just need an hour! Be a
good guy, will ya?

425
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,019
Shut up. Get in.

426
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:08,936
What are you talking, Kvorka? You looking
to get sued for libel or somethin'?

427
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,811
I could sue you right now.

428
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,353
You're lookin' good, Dealer.
Real good.

429
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:14,811
When they let ya out?

430
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:16,269
Monday, they let me out.

431
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,144
What's the charge, Kvorka?

432
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:19,561
Shoplifting from Brach's.

433
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,228
This suit.

434
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,894
Who told ya a thing like that?

435
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:22,853
Little bird.

436
00:21:23,686 --> 00:21:25,394
Little bird with a cigar.

437
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:26,978
Schwiefka!

438
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,978
That all ya could stay
outta trouble?

439
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:29,894
Two days?

440
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:31,353
Dealer, Dealer.

441
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:34,478
Listen, Bednar. I got a chance for
a job playin' with a band.

442
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:37,519
Honest! If you don't believe me call the
guy on the phone. He'll tell ya.

443
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,519
Well, just give me a half hour. Please?

444
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:41,561
Sure, you can wear my badge too.

445
00:21:41,811 --> 00:21:43,144
Book him, and hold the suit.

446
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,936
Look, all I need's a half hour.
Gimme a break, will ya?

447
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,936
I don't make the rules, Dealer.

448
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:56,769
Now, listen. I tell ya, ya can't hold me...

449
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:58,144
...I'm unencapable.

450
00:21:58,478 --> 00:22:01,269
I ain't smart enough to be
runnin' around loose.

451
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:03,978
And I'm too goofy to
be locked up.

452
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,228
The neck! Will ya let go
of the neck?

453
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:08,603
- I got a complaint to make.
- Let go of the neck!

454
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:11,353
Hey you! I'm talkin' to you.

455
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,728
Oh, the old silent treatment, huh?

456
00:22:14,894 --> 00:22:16,728
All right. Let's have ya number, fella.

457
00:22:16,978 --> 00:22:19,186
I'll show ya, ya can't give
me the business.

458
00:22:19,353 --> 00:22:21,186
Your goose is cooked, copper!

459
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,853
Oh, God...

460
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:36,894
Frankie, ya got a cigarette?

461
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:43,894
Do a cigarette trick.

462
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:46,603
You know, just to break
the daily monotony.

463
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,603
Wow!

464
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,061
Psst!

465
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:05,978
Dealer.

466
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:18,686
Hello, Dealer.

467
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,686
I come runnin' as soon
as I heard.

468
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,186
Ya want I should get
ya out, Dealer?

469
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,186
You fink!

470
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:27,436
The store will drop the charges.

471
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:29,436
But thirty-seven bucks' a
lot of dough.

472
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,103
How'd I know ya'd pay me back?

473
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,644
You fink!

474
00:23:34,436 --> 00:23:36,353
Be different if you was
dealin' for me.

475
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,978
If you wanna deal for me,
I can get ya out.

476
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:41,978
Dirty, lousy stool pigeon!

477
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:44,228
I don't know what ya mean.

478
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:47,436
Just tryin' to do ya a favour.

479
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:51,519
Yes or no?!

480
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,936
Okay.

481
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:05,353
Took off like a whipped dog.

482
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,644
He's scared of you, Frankie.

483
00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:11,311
Nobody's ever been scared of me.

484
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,686
Them Krauts was scared of you.

485
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:15,978
You was a big man in the army.

486
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:16,769
Big man.

487
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,644
I was the guy that picked the fly
spots outta the black pepper.

488
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,353
Get me out!
Get me out! I can't take it!

489
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,353
Can't stand it! Get me out!

490
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,353
Get me out!

491
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,186
Get me out!

492
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:35,478
Out! Get me out!

493
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:39,269
I wanna fix! I wanna fix!
I wanna fix!

494
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:42,186
Can you gimme a fix?

495
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,186
Can ya? Can ya gimme a fix?

496
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:46,186
Can ya gimme a fix?
I wanna fix!

497
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:48,811
I wanna fix! Gimme a fix!

498
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:51,478
Gimme a fix! I wanna fix!

499
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,978
Aw, gimme a fix, go on!

500
00:24:57,644 --> 00:24:59,436
Jack's check, bullets say a buck.

501
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:01,603
Big AC's. Here we go down and dirty.

502
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,144
Better luck next time, friend.

503
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,894
Man with a hammer
bumps a buck.

504
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:06,894
Jack calls.

505
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:10,269
Bucket of paint, all red.

506
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:10,978
Coffee!

507
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:13,436
Doesn't mean a thing, if ya
haven't got the King.

508
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:16,519
A winner every hand. You bet
more, you get more.

509
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:18,978
Slip me half, make me laugh.

510
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,311
You still take tips, Dealer?

511
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,311
Or don't they pay so good
in the music game?

512
00:25:26,103 --> 00:25:27,853
What happened to that big
job you had lined up?

513
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:29,103
You stink out the joint?

514
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,103
Give us a fresh deck.

515
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,894
I decide when we need a
fresh deck at this table.

516
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:34,936
Hey, Louie...

517
00:25:35,394 --> 00:25:36,936
...borrow me a dirty dollar?

518
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:38,936
Get back on the door,
lame brain.

519
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,228
I take orders only from Frankie.

520
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:43,019
Don't give me lip, ya cheap
little hustler.

521
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:46,186
Hustler, schmustler. I'm legit
compared to some.

522
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:49,394
Ain't no fourteen-year-old junkies
waitin' around to see me!

523
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:52,311
Do you wanna die?

524
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,228
And here we go, down and dirty.

525
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:06,144
Hey!

526
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:08,894
I'll deal the next one down.

527
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:13,561
Sorry.

528
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:16,936
What's it a sign of, when a dealer's
hands begin to shake?

529
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,019
Schwiefka, take the slot
for a while, will ya?

530
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,186
All right, then, new deal.

531
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,644
Okay, then, here we go,
down and dirty.

532
00:26:31,144 --> 00:26:32,936
Ah, Ace. Seven.

533
00:26:50,186 --> 00:26:51,561
You know what's eatin' at ya?

534
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,478
You shot off the mouth about
kickin' it for keeps.

535
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:57,061
So now you're ashamed
of even thinkin'...

536
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:59,603
...well, what you're thinkin'.
Ain't that right?

537
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,769
You know I don't talk about my customers,
so who'd be the wiser?

538
00:27:04,894 --> 00:27:07,061
Why fight it, Dealer? For
who? For what?

539
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:09,686
Come over my place.

540
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:10,853
Whaddya say?

541
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:12,103
Huh?

542
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:18,728
I'll be around.

543
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,769
They told me you was
workin' here an' I...

544
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,144
...was passin' by an' I thought I'd
come in an' have a drink.

545
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:18,353
Oh, I've been here a while.

546
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:20,561
Doin' any good?

547
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:21,728
All right.

548
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:24,436
Small cut on the game, usual
cut on the drinks.

549
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:25,978
Ain't got all night, Jack.

550
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:27,561
Right.

551
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,061
Have something.

552
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:31,394
- Rye.
- Two doubles.

553
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:33,978
You didn't have to do
that, Frankie.

554
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:37,811
No reason you should go losin' money
by wastin' your time talkin' to me.

555
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,519
You know you're no waste.

556
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:42,436
I've been hopin' you'd come see me.

557
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:45,269
You know how it is, Molly.

558
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:46,478
Sure...

559
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,478
...so busy, and all.

560
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:58,103
Well, here's to it, Molly-o.

561
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:01,353
"Molly-o".

562
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:03,811
I ain't heard that since
you went away.

563
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:10,061
You're lookin' good, Frankie.

564
00:29:10,478 --> 00:29:11,103
Feelgood.

565
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:14,186
They tell me you're gonna be
a drummer now.

566
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,394
Yeah!

567
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:17,894
I got an appointment with
a man tomorrow.

568
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:19,478
Oh, that's swell.

569
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,811
Ah, probably I won't get
the job, though.

570
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,769
Sure ya will.

571
00:29:22,978 --> 00:29:24,353
Probably I don't play good enough.

572
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,353
I bet ya play fine.

573
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:28,603
You was always whistlin', drummin'
on tables and things.

574
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,603
Real good, too.

575
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,394
- Aach!
- No, I mean it.

576
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:34,811
You've got a natural rhythm.

577
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,811
I was thinkin', maybe I'd
take a stage name.

578
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,811
"Jack Duval".

579
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,144
Jack Duval.

580
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:43,769
Yeah, that's real class.

581
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,061
It is, ain't it.

582
00:29:45,144 --> 00:29:46,311
That's a swell name.

583
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:47,686
Just fits ya, Frank.

584
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:51,186
This guy I'm gonna see tomorrow,
he books all the big bands.

585
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,394
If I get in with him, boy,
I'll wear a tux.

586
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:55,144
You'll look swell in a tux.

587
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:56,144
I already got the drums.

588
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:56,811
I---

589
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,478
I need a buck.

590
00:29:59,061 --> 00:30:00,728
Ante-up kid, huh?

591
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:14,894
I got lonely.

592
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:18,894
I needed somebody, and he's a...

593
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,353
...poor, beat guy who needs
somebody too.

594
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:25,603
Everybody needs somebody.

595
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,978
But you can do better than him.

596
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:30,644
Can I, Frankie?

597
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:37,853
Molly, I...

598
00:30:40,894 --> 00:30:42,894
...I thought a lot about you,
while I was away.

599
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,894
About you and me and Zosch.

600
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:49,811
How it'd never work out between
you and me as long as...

601
00:30:49,894 --> 00:30:52,228
...she was upstairs sitting
in that chair.

602
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,644
It'd be different if she didn't love me
an', she wasn't so helpless.

603
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:05,519
You can't make a fool of somebody who
loves ya, an'--- an' they're so helpless.

604
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,311
That's why I didn't come
around sooner.

605
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:11,519
And that's why I ain't comin'
around no more.

606
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:13,686
You understand?

607
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:18,478
Sure... sure, I understand.

608
00:31:22,894 --> 00:31:24,686
You're a good girl, Molly.

609
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,061
Sure. Real good.

610
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:31,936
Frankie?

611
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,353
Good luck with that
fella tomorrow.

612
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:52,603
You're not the first to come to me
with a letter from Dr Lennox.

613
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:54,769
I've taken care of a lot
of you people.

614
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:55,728
The Doc, he told me.

615
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,228
I like doin' it, understand...

616
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:59,769
so don't feel that this is charity
or anything like that.

617
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:01,394
Now, um...

618
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,144
...have you played professionally before?

619
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,353
Only down at Lexington.

620
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:06,353
I see. Well, then you wouldn't
mind auditioning?

621
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,811
I mean, I know some band leaders
who might have an opening...

622
00:32:08,936 --> 00:32:10,478
...but they'd have to be sure
that you could play.

623
00:32:10,603 --> 00:32:12,853
- Oh, sure, sure.
- All right, then.

624
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:15,561
There's only one thing, Frankie.

625
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,686
You see...

626
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,686
...a good many people like yourself...

627
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,686
...well, they mean well, but they're...

628
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:24,103
...well, they're weak. They let me down.

629
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,561
I mean...

630
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:28,353
...I go to all this trouble. Vouch for them...

631
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,644
...and they go back on the habit.

632
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:32,644
It makes me look bad.

633
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,394
Oh, I wouldn't. Honest.

634
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,394
All right, I'm telling you this because...

635
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:39,853
...well, once a man lets me down,
I'm done with him.

636
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:42,519
He comes back on his knees.

637
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:44,894
And don't think that some
of them haven't.

638
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,728
I wouldn't let you down, Mr Lane.

639
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:47,228
Good.

640
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:50,519
I'll call you, er... let me see, urn...

641
00:32:50,686 --> 00:32:52,228
...a week from Friday. About noon.

642
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,228
- All right?
- Fine.

643
00:32:54,894 --> 00:32:55,894
I sure do appreciate it.

644
00:32:55,936 --> 00:32:56,686
Aw, forget it.

645
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,686
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

646
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:08,978
You like my hair better this way -
or upswept, Frankie?

647
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:10,728
Huh?

648
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:16,019
Well, you can at least tell me? it
ain't my fault he don't phone.

649
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:17,811
What did I say?

650
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:21,686
"Just don't hold your breath 'till you hear
from that guy." That's what I said.

651
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,894
He told you noon, and here it is
almost six o'clock already...

652
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:26,061
...so how can you still
think he'll phone?

653
00:33:26,478 --> 00:33:28,603
Honest, I'm surprised at ya!

654
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:36,936
Why... I just don't want ya should
eat your heart out, is all.

655
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:40,519
Forget the whole thing, Frankie.
I bet he has.

656
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,936
Do you think he's got nothing better
to do than worry about you?

657
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:46,769
Do you think he don't sleep nights,
on account of Frankie Machine?

658
00:33:47,728 --> 00:33:49,061
- Bet he don't get no---
- Ha!

659
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:04,603
Excuse me, erm...

660
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:09,269
Hello?

661
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,936
Oh. Just a minute.

662
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:13,936
It's for you.

663
00:34:14,894 --> 00:34:15,936
Hello...?

664
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,644
Are you Dr. Dominovski?

665
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,686
Yes, I came as soon as I could.

666
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:26,353
Oh.

667
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:35,561
Well, how ya feelin', little lady?

668
00:34:36,394 --> 00:34:39,061
See? The doc asks "how am I feelin'."

669
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:42,603
Ah, we'll have you feelin' fine
in one, two, thu-ree.

670
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:44,603
What is this?

671
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:49,269
It happens, friend, to be an Electric Blood
Reverser and Spine Manipulator.

672
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,061
It helps to reverse the blood.

673
00:34:51,644 --> 00:34:53,394
- What's the gimmick?
- Gimmick?

674
00:34:54,019 --> 00:34:55,436
It happens so, brother, that...

675
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:59,061
...I am a member of the American
Association of Medical Hydrology...

676
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,061
...Psychology and Divine Healing.

677
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:02,019
Where's the socket?

678
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,478
Mmm, cold hands.

679
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:08,728
Poor circulation.

680
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:10,144
Eat lots of hot things.

681
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:12,353
Chilli, peppers, hot sauces.

682
00:35:12,436 --> 00:35:12,978
Pickles?

683
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,978
Er, not more than three a day.

684
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:20,311
Now, lean forward.

685
00:35:20,353 --> 00:35:22,311
And we'll vibrate the vertebraes.

686
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,686
Do you know how I got like I am?

687
00:35:26,936 --> 00:35:28,019
My spine was hurt.

688
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:29,436
Oh, I can see that.

689
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,894
The little fibres in the vertebrae
is locked together.

690
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:33,894
In a car accident, it was hurt.

691
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:35,894
Three years ago, May 11th.

692
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,311
Maybe you've read about it
in the papers, huh?

693
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,728
This is the car it happened in.

694
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,686
That's me, laying there.

695
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:50,228
My husband was the one driving
the car, and he was drunk.

696
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:50,978
Drunk, eh?

697
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:53,936
He got me in this accident, and smashed
me up good so's I can't...

698
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:55,936
...walk no more or dance no
more or nothin'.

699
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:57,644
An' he married me right here...

700
00:35:57,728 --> 00:35:59,894
- ...in the hospital chapel.
- Zosch!

701
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:12,478
Feelin' a little better?

702
00:36:13,353 --> 00:36:14,019
Uh-huh.

703
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,019
Much better.

704
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:33,269
Help yourself.

705
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:37,519
Hey, Frankie - guess what?
I got that dog for Zosch.

706
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:42,603
Drinks beer and every claw and
hair of him's a champeen.

707
00:36:42,644 --> 00:36:44,603
- Champeen of what?
- Retrievin'!

708
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:45,644
He brings back empties.

709
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,436
Here, I show ya. Come
on, Beauty. Here.

710
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:49,978
Get it, Beauty.

711
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:53,936
He's all dog.

712
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,936
Ya can make money outta
him, Frankie.

713
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:57,186
See, what he's good at...

714
00:36:57,228 --> 00:37:00,644
...is catching them squirrels in the park, and
shaking their dirty peanuts outta 'm.

715
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,728
Y'know what I mean?

716
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:05,019
Only thing - he's trained to chase
only one kinda squirrel.

717
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:08,394
And they're gettin' kinda rare in Chicago,
on account of the climate's changin'.

718
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:09,269
Y'know what I mean?

719
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:13,811
So he's just hanging around, waitin' for
the climate to change back a little.

720
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:15,519
He's got a real fightin' heart.

721
00:37:15,686 --> 00:37:18,394
He's dizzy, but he's still in there tryin'.

722
00:37:26,394 --> 00:37:28,728
- Take the dog up to Zosch.
- Frankie!

723
00:37:29,186 --> 00:37:30,728
Can I go with ya?

724
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:31,853
No.

725
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,978
In a minute, Dealer.

726
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:53,019
Five bucks.

727
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:57,728
Last time it was two.

728
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,478
That was more than six months ago.
Before you went away.

729
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,978
They keep raising the price on me.

730
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,436
They keep doin' that? Hm.

731
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,061
I'll have to find somethin'
to take its place.

732
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:22,894
Monkey's never dead, Dealer.

733
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,103
The monkey never dies.

734
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,561
When ya kick him off...

735
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:33,061
...he just hides in a corner,
waitin' his turn.

736
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,728
The monkey'll die waitin'.

737
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:02,269
He ain't climbin' up on
my back no more.

738
00:40:03,394 --> 00:40:04,769
Never again.

739
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:06,186
I mean it.

740
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,186
Sure.

741
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:11,561
Sure.

742
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:23,103
Look, Frankie!

743
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,519
Look how he drinks it.

744
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:26,311
Oh, he's so cute!

745
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:31,228
- He's gotta thirst like a barfly!
- Shh, shh, shh.

746
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:34,519
Hallo?

747
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,561
You still expectin' that
connection to call?

748
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:41,769
For your own peace of
mind, forget him.

749
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:46,519
The Doc said I could count on Mr Lane,
and the Doc doesn't lie.

750
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:47,728
The Doc!

751
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:51,228
Look at me. A doc told you I'd be up
and around in no time. An' am I?

752
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:55,811
Have you seen my sticks?

753
00:40:56,311 --> 00:40:57,811
Seen my drumsticks anywhere?

754
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:00,353
You know what I'm going to
get for this little dog?

755
00:41:00,686 --> 00:41:02,978
A little raincoat, like for when it rains.

756
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,686
Plaid, maybe.

757
00:41:05,269 --> 00:41:06,686
Or maybe all yeller, huh?

758
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,894
Where are my drumsticks, Zosch?

759
00:41:11,644 --> 00:41:12,728
How'd they get up here?

760
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:15,019
Ya liked that, didn't ya? Hm?

761
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:17,019
Zosch, I never keep 'em way up here.

762
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,228
Drank it all up, didn't ya. Huh?

763
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,228
Zosch!

764
00:41:26,811 --> 00:41:28,186
I put 'em there.

765
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:31,644
I stood right up. I walked right over
and I put 'em there. All right?

766
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:32,436
No kiddin'. How did---

767
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,978
Maybe Vi, when she was straightenin'
up for me. I don't know.

768
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,644
Stop pickin' on me!

769
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:45,978
Frankie.

770
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:50,478
Ya can't keep stonin' yourself about it.

771
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:55,144
There must be a million drummers play
better'n you do can't get jobs.

772
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:57,853
Just remember that, an' you're
gonna feel better.

773
00:41:58,728 --> 00:41:59,853
Yeah, sure I will.

774
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,269
Yeah.

775
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:06,936
Can the noise!

776
00:42:20,478 --> 00:42:22,019
What's this for, Zosch?

777
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:23,394
What?

778
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:25,811
Oh! Vi.

779
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,811
She laid out for groceries.

780
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:29,811
We owe her even more.

781
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:31,811
You got any?

782
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:34,394
No.

783
00:42:35,478 --> 00:42:37,811
I don't know what we're doin'
with all our money.

784
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,394
Don't ya get enough cards
by Schwiefka?

785
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:49,269
I just do it to kill the past
time, that's all.

786
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:51,269
What about my past time?

787
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:55,186
What'd you say this is for?

788
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,728
Sit here all the time, you
don't even talk to me.

789
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:01,228
Have we got any more beer?

790
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:03,144
I'd like some.

791
00:43:04,353 --> 00:43:07,103
Beer bloats, Zosch, when
ya can't exercise.

792
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:08,686
Here, pick a card.

793
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,353
Everythin's no good for me.

794
00:43:10,644 --> 00:43:13,436
I, I'm only twenty-five and it's like
I'm an old lady already.

795
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:16,186
Is it my fault I can't exercise?

796
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:18,853
You wanna pick a card or don't
ya wanna pick a card?

797
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:21,061
No, I don't wanna pick a card!

798
00:43:21,394 --> 00:43:24,186
All I want is... just a little---

799
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,311
Little what, Zosch?

800
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,311
Oh, just a little---

801
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:33,561
A little beer, a little fun -
a little anything!

802
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:37,103
I can't dance no more. I can't swim.
And now I can't even drink beer!

803
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:39,603
I don't even know what kinds
they got any more.

804
00:43:41,478 --> 00:43:43,769
What other kinds they got
these days, Frankie?

805
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:48,603
All right! Pretend like I ain't here.

806
00:43:48,728 --> 00:43:51,228
It's what you're all the time wishin' anyway.
That I got killed that night.

807
00:43:51,811 --> 00:43:53,519
I don't wish any such thing!

808
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:59,186
If I don't talk, you get mad. If I say
anything, you bite my head off.

809
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,228
I don't know whether I'm comin'
or goin' anymore, Zosch.

810
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:07,603
I told ya. It gives me headaches.

811
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:10,394
Well, I gotta practise sometime, Zosch.

812
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:12,394
The job comes along, I wanna be ready.

813
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:14,394
Job? The job!

814
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:17,478
Take 'em down to ya girlfriend
if ya gotta practise.

815
00:44:25,811 --> 00:44:26,353
What?

816
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:30,186
Take them down and give
her the headache.

817
00:44:34,686 --> 00:44:37,769
Do ya know what ya sayin', Zosch?
Ya know what ya talkin' about?

818
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:40,978
Don't give me that innocent look.

819
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:44,019
I ain't said two words to her
since I come back.

820
00:44:44,603 --> 00:44:47,269
Just cause I sit here, you think
I don't know what goes on?

821
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,269
Not two words.

822
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,269
I know plenty.

823
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,478
Cut it out, will ya, Zosch?
Cut it out.

824
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:02,228
Take 'em down to that tramp if
you wanna make noise.

825
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:04,228
Go on, take 'em down to her,
why don't ya?

826
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,228
All right. I Will.

827
00:45:18,144 --> 00:45:19,186
Frankie!

828
00:45:19,478 --> 00:45:21,186
Frankie, I didn't mean---

829
00:45:23,061 --> 00:45:25,478
"it's a long drive to right field."

830
00:45:25,561 --> 00:45:27,686
"it's going, going, it's gone!"

831
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,228
"it's a home run!"

832
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,519
I got twelve cents toward a beer - if
I had fifteen, I'd be all right.

833
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,686
- I got, urn, six cents here. Here ya are.
- Thanks.

834
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,269
I ain't gonna stand it much longer.

835
00:45:38,644 --> 00:45:40,936
The heartaches my old man gives me.

836
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:43,644
You know what he likes to do most?

837
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:46,019
Tear the dates off the calendar.

838
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:47,061
Watchin' 'im.

839
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:50,269
That's supposed to be my big
Saturday night pleasure.

840
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:54,061
Sometimes he loses all control and tears
off a whole week's at once.

841
00:45:54,478 --> 00:45:56,269
Bleatin' like a billy goat.

842
00:45:56,478 --> 00:45:59,019
You know what would fill up that
empty spot in your life?

843
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:01,019
- Yeah?
- A dawg.

844
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:02,769
Ask a satisfied customer.

845
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:04,686
Frankie, that, that, that dawg I got ya...

846
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:06,353
...makes a big difference in
ya life, don't it?

847
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:07,144
Yeah, big.

848
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,728
"Dobbs to second."

849
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,228
I wanna see you.

850
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:14,644
I wanna see you!

851
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:16,311
After the innin'!

852
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:17,853
I'll still bet ya six to five.

853
00:46:17,853 --> 00:46:20,311
"---pitch. And it's a strike. Strike one."

854
00:46:23,603 --> 00:46:25,144
"London's getting set again."

855
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:28,644
"There's the pitch - London swings.
And it's a high foul."

856
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,019
"Loveridge is trying to get it. "

857
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:31,269
"it may go into the stands."

858
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:33,811
"He's, he's going to try. It's
going to be close."

859
00:46:34,103 --> 00:46:35,894
"Roberts makes a tremendous leap and---"

860
00:46:35,936 --> 00:46:37,228
How are you, Frankie?

861
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:40,853
You make out all right with
the fella with the job'?

862
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:43,644
What, the drumming job?
Yeah, fine, fine.

863
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,353
Well... not so fine.

864
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:48,353
He sorta tapped out on me.

865
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:50,894
He promised to call me but---

866
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,103
It's too bad.

867
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,353
A million drummers in the
world, how do I rate?

868
00:46:57,936 --> 00:46:59,061
Maybe he lost your number?

869
00:46:59,144 --> 00:47:01,061
- Aach!
- It happens.

870
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:03,728
Maybe he's just wishin' you'd...

871
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:05,728
...you'd get in touch.

872
00:47:06,853 --> 00:47:08,394
He'd think I was a pest.

873
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:10,478
Should he?

874
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,019
Good drummer, that's somethin'
that don't turn up every day.

875
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:16,353
Go on, Frankie. Call him.

876
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,269
Call him, Frankie.

877
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,811
Come on, Molly. Watch
the game, huh?

878
00:47:38,394 --> 00:47:40,769
Oh. I don't feel like it, Johnny.

879
00:47:40,936 --> 00:47:42,561
Why don't you go ahead?
I'll wait for you.

880
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:51,311
Yeah, Studio B. Monday morning.

881
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:52,894
Fine. Thank you, Mr Lane.

882
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,061
Bye.

883
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:58,853
Monday! I got an audition
Monday. Me!

884
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:00,853
Yeah. He told me to join the union,
and be ready to work.

885
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:02,019
Oh, that's swell, Frankie.

886
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:03,519
You know, he did lose
my phone number.

887
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:05,144
He was trying to find
me all week long.

888
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:07,144
Here I was, ready to forget
the whole thing.

889
00:48:07,311 --> 00:48:09,269
Gee, if you hadn't opened your mouth
I wouldn't have called him.

890
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:10,353
Oh, sure you would.

891
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:12,353
I got an audition with a big band.

892
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:13,728
Me, on TV.

893
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,144
Practise a lot, Frank.

894
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,936
Practise, I'll beat those
heads to a shred.

895
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,311
Only, I gotta find a place where.

896
00:48:21,186 --> 00:48:22,644
Zosch can't stand the noise.

897
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:25,686
Molly?

898
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,103
D'you suppose, maybe, I could
put the drums in...

899
00:48:28,228 --> 00:48:29,103
...your place, an'...

900
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,103
...sorta drop in, once in a while?

901
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:34,311
Why not?

902
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:36,811
Molly, why not?

903
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:41,061
Oh... Johnny wouldn't understand.

904
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,519
So what could he do?

905
00:48:44,686 --> 00:48:46,769
It ain't a question of what
he could do, Frankie.

906
00:48:48,186 --> 00:48:50,311
Fella like Johnny can't do
much about anything.

907
00:48:51,478 --> 00:48:53,144
It's a question of what
it does to him.

908
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:55,603
I'm all he has in the world.

909
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,811
Don't want to hurt him.

910
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:59,269
Molly - for cryin' out loud!

911
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,269
Oh, you don't know, Frankie.

912
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:02,811
A fella like him...

913
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:06,603
...sometimes, when we're alone---

914
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,269
What does he do? Cry?

915
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:10,269
He's a lush, Molly.

916
00:49:10,436 --> 00:49:12,519
He's a hundred-percent,
habitual drunk.

917
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,644
Look, everybody's a habitual somethin'.

918
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:16,644
With him it's liquor, is all.

919
00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:18,644
Please, Molly? Molly-0?

920
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:20,644
It ain't just that, Frankie.

921
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:25,561
I don't want us to start with
each other again.

922
00:49:26,603 --> 00:49:28,894
Look, what you said about
us not being good...

923
00:49:29,103 --> 00:49:30,061
...it was the truth.

924
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,769
Even before you went away, I...

925
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:35,228
...I tried to---

926
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:38,936
It just doesn't add up.

927
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,394
It never did. It never can.

928
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:44,311
Well, give it a chance. I told
you it would, one day.

929
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:47,394
All my life has been "one day".

930
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:51,478
On and on and on.

931
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:54,186
I got drums. I'm headed
for a good job.

932
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:56,186
Is that so "on and on and on"?

933
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,478
I'll make some money.
Make Zosch well.

934
00:49:58,561 --> 00:50:00,478
What's so "on and on and
on" about that?

935
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,394
Don't shut me out, Molly.
I'm tryin'.

936
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:04,728
You wanted to see me?

937
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:06,186
No!

938
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:08,811
What do ya mean "no"?

939
00:50:14,686 --> 00:50:15,603
Vi?

940
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:17,936
Here.

941
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,019
What we owe.

942
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:21,103
Frankie, Vi says "Can she trust me?"

943
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,519
Tell her, tell her, Frankie, what
a honest hustler I am.

944
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:25,728
Frankie.

945
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:29,728
I guess, maybe, you could
drop in once in a while.

946
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,186
Thanks, Molly-o.

947
00:50:46,561 --> 00:50:47,436
See you tonight.

948
00:52:02,811 --> 00:52:03,353
How's that?

949
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:04,561
Real nice.

950
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,561
Shoulda heard what I did with
Perdido a little while ago.

951
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:13,269
Good, huh?

952
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:15,436
I hope the neighbours liked it, too.

953
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:18,228
I'm very big with the neighbours.

954
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:20,603
They keep bangin' on the pipes...

955
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:22,811
...to let me know how much
they appreciate it.

956
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:25,936
I won't let it go to my head, though.

957
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,228
You keep playing drums...

958
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,811
...at five a.m. and you'll see
what goes to your head.

959
00:52:36,144 --> 00:52:38,019
You slip me a smile, and I'll
give you my autograph.

960
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:41,894
You won't have to fight your way through
the bobby-soxers to get to me.

961
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:44,603
I'll bet those bobby-soxers
go for ya, at that.

962
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:45,853
Aach!

963
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:52,186
You tired?

964
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,561
But in a very nice way.

965
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,561
I've been feelin' good all night.

966
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,061
I joined a musicians union today.

967
00:53:02,228 --> 00:53:03,394
Schwiefka loan ya the money?

968
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:05,353
Him? Huh.

969
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:07,269
Who did?

970
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:08,228
Nobody.

971
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,519
I'm gonna hock the drums.

972
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:12,519
Oh, Frankie, no!

973
00:53:12,644 --> 00:53:14,061
I got it figured out pretty good.

974
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:17,103
When I get a job, I'll take an advance,
and get the drums out again.

975
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:19,103
Meantime, I'll use a practice pad.

976
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:21,103
Ya shoulda' asked Schwiefka.

977
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:23,436
Haven't even seen him.

978
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:25,436
You didn't go to work?

979
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,436
I've been practisin' here all night.

980
00:53:28,769 --> 00:53:30,144
I quit the game, Molly.

981
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,353
It wouldn't have hurt ya to wait
a coupla days, Frank.

982
00:53:35,186 --> 00:53:36,311
I wanted to quit.

983
00:53:37,644 --> 00:53:39,269
I'm quittin' a couple of things.

984
00:53:45,769 --> 00:53:46,686
Is it bad?

985
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:51,894
Not too bad.

986
00:53:57,478 --> 00:53:58,936
You shouldn'a started again.

987
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:02,019
Who knows why I started
in the first place.

988
00:54:04,394 --> 00:54:06,686
I guess, in the beginning you
do it only for kicks.

989
00:54:10,019 --> 00:54:11,978
Louie gave me my first
shot for nothin'.

990
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:16,436
I thought I could take it,
or leave it alone.

991
00:54:16,978 --> 00:54:17,811
So I took it.

992
00:54:18,228 --> 00:54:20,019
And I took it again and again.

993
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:24,311
And one day, Louie wasn't around.

994
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:26,894
I nearly went crazy,
till I found him.

995
00:54:28,853 --> 00:54:30,144
Oh, I was sick.

996
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,811
I was so sick.

997
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,019
You can't be that
sick and live.

998
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:41,311
That's when I knew
I was hooked.

999
00:54:43,186 --> 00:54:45,644
There was a forty-pound
monkey on my back.

1000
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:52,728
The only way to get along with a load
like that, is to keep leanin' on a fix.

1001
00:55:00,853 --> 00:55:01,686
Don't.

1002
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:05,228
Don't.

1003
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:09,978
I'm one of the lucky ones, Molly.

1004
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:15,019
I kicked it, and I'm not too far
hooked to kick it again.

1005
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,269
I've had my last fix.

1006
00:55:17,394 --> 00:55:18,728
I mean it, Molly.

1007
00:55:21,561 --> 00:55:22,561
Tell me somethin'.

1008
00:55:23,269 --> 00:55:25,686
You think those bobby-soxers
will really go for me?

1009
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:30,478
You're goin' to be such a ham.

1010
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:37,019
Yeah, maybe I'll get Sparrow
a job with the orchestra.

1011
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:42,519
Or when I can put enough money together
I can get Zosch into a...

1012
00:55:43,311 --> 00:55:44,853
...real good hospital.

1013
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:47,144
So she can walk and dance again.

1014
00:55:49,686 --> 00:55:50,811
And then, maybe---

1015
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:31,144
- Who is it?
- Schwiefka. Open up.

1016
00:57:32,728 --> 00:57:33,686
Just a minute.

1017
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:43,061
- All right, all right. Where is he?
- Good morning, Mrs Machine.

1018
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:44,978
- Frankie?
- Frankie! Where is he?

1019
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,311
What is it? What'd he do?

1020
00:57:46,394 --> 00:57:47,894
What'd he do? You
know what he did.

1021
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:48,728
He quit!

1022
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:50,019
No notice. No nuthin'.

1023
00:57:50,186 --> 00:57:52,103
He sends word by that misfit
that he's through.

1024
00:57:52,186 --> 00:57:53,769
I had to take the spot myself.

1025
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:55,019
- Where is he?!
- Aah!

1026
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:56,311
Oh!

1027
00:57:56,686 --> 00:57:57,978
He wasn't at the game?

1028
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:01,144
Would we be lookin' for him all over
if he was at the game?

1029
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,269
He eats my bread. Six years
he eats my bread.

1030
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:06,269
He gets put away, I send
ya money regular.

1031
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:07,728
He gets out, I give him
his job back, I---

1032
00:58:07,728 --> 00:58:08,311
Shut up.

1033
00:58:08,436 --> 00:58:09,644
- What do you mean "shut up"?
- Shut up!

1034
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:13,061
You think it was easy talkin' fellas
like Williams and Marquette...

1035
00:58:13,103 --> 00:58:14,228
...up to a two-bit game like yours?

1036
00:58:14,269 --> 00:58:16,103
- Louie, Louie, I---
- I sold 'em on Frankie.

1037
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:17,144
Why we gettin' excited?

1038
00:58:17,186 --> 00:58:19,728
They... they're fat in the pocket
and hungry for action.

1039
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:22,019
We finally get a chance
to score big...

1040
00:58:22,853 --> 00:58:24,478
...and you lose the Dealer.

1041
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:26,894
Look, Louie, I swear...

1042
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:29,394
...I swear, when Marquette and Williams
come the Dealer will be there.

1043
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:30,811
Or a player just as good.

1044
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:31,978
There ain't none as good.

1045
00:58:32,436 --> 00:58:34,478
Why didn't you offer him more money?
A piece of the play, even?

1046
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:35,936
From your end or mine?

1047
00:58:35,978 --> 00:58:37,561
What's the difference whose end?!

1048
00:58:37,644 --> 00:58:39,728
You expect me to stand here and
argue about pennies?

1049
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,728
Your end!

1050
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:52,186
Look“.

1051
00:58:53,811 --> 00:58:54,853
I'm a musician.

1052
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:56,519
Well, how does it feel?

1053
00:58:56,894 --> 00:58:58,228
Well, it feels like...

1054
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:01,644
...you better hang onto my arm
or I go up like a balloon.

1055
00:59:02,894 --> 00:59:03,936
I'm a musician.

1056
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:07,144
Where're we goin'?

1057
00:59:07,603 --> 00:59:09,394
I dunno. But I wanna
buy you something.

1058
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:10,478
Ah, no.

1059
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:12,478
I gotta spend some
money or I'll bust.

1060
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,353
How about one of those in green?

1061
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:15,853
Oh, Frankie.

1062
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,811
Maybe a colour TV set?

1063
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:18,519
They're pretty-

1064
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:19,644
Go on.

1065
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:22,603
Will ya look at this production?

1066
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:25,103
And only for cookin'.

1067
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,686
Now who would wanna
thing like that?

1068
00:59:27,853 --> 00:59:28,686
Boy...

1069
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:30,519
...it's goofy, huh?

1070
00:59:30,644 --> 00:59:32,228
It's pretty, huh?

1071
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:34,894
I wonder what he does
for a livin'?

1072
00:59:35,353 --> 00:59:35,936
Him?

1073
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:39,144
Well, he must make a nice dollar.

1074
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:40,853
Look the way he dresses her.

1075
00:59:41,228 --> 00:59:42,353
Kitchen like that.

1076
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,269
I notice he don't help her
none, though.

1077
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:45,853
I bet he never even married the girl.

1078
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:47,853
Look at that - she ain't even
wearing a ring on her finger.

1079
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:49,853
She takes it off when
she cooks, maybe?

1080
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:52,936
And he's tired after a
hard day's work.

1081
00:59:53,686 --> 00:59:54,978
All right, so let him sit there...

1082
00:59:54,978 --> 00:59:56,978
...but at least he could talk
to her once in a while.

1083
00:59:57,019 --> 00:59:59,603
Doesn't have to sit there with his
nose buried in a magazine.

1084
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:01,103
I would talk to her.

1085
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:02,478
What would you say?

1086
01:00:03,478 --> 01:00:04,769
Oh, I'd say "how ya been?"...

1087
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:06,228
..."how did it go today?"...

1088
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,186
..."what's for supper?".

1089
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:08,894
Steak. Steak's for supper.

1090
01:00:08,936 --> 01:00:10,478
And everything went fine today.

1091
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:11,853
Steak? Good.

1092
01:00:12,311 --> 01:00:13,811
Now, how about you and
me steppin' out...

1093
01:00:13,853 --> 01:00:15,436
...tonight, after we eat?

1094
01:00:15,978 --> 01:00:17,478
Why don't we just stay home?

1095
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,769
Turn on some music.

1096
01:00:19,644 --> 01:00:20,394
Yeah.

1097
01:00:21,478 --> 01:00:22,644
I like that better.

1098
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,686
We'll just stay home and
turn on some music.

1099
01:00:27,686 --> 01:00:29,144
I wish it was Monday, already.

1100
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:34,061
Hi Zosch.

1101
01:00:34,144 --> 01:00:35,519
Oh! Where ya been?

1102
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:37,603
Schwiefka was here - said you quit him.

1103
01:00:37,769 --> 01:00:38,353
Where you been?

1104
01:00:38,353 --> 01:00:38,769
Look.

1105
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:39,853
Why'd you quit him?

1106
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,061
I got a tryout on Monday.

1107
01:00:41,103 --> 01:00:43,311
And if the bandleader likes the
way I play - I'm hired.

1108
01:00:43,478 --> 01:00:44,061
Frankie...

1109
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:45,811
Go tell Schwiefka you was foolin'.

1110
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:46,853
You'll deal.

1111
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,103
Maybe this bandleader won't
like how you play?

1112
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,103
Zosch! Look - I joined the Musician's Union.

1113
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:54,811
Why you gotta go around
changin' things?

1114
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:57,103
Why can't it be like always?

1115
01:00:58,144 --> 01:01:00,228
Why you gotta quit dealin', Frankie?

1116
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:02,644
How we gonna live with
no money comin' in?

1117
01:01:02,686 --> 01:01:04,228
It'll start comin' in - Monday.

1118
01:01:04,311 --> 01:01:06,228
But, suppose they call this
great tryout off?

1119
01:01:06,269 --> 01:01:08,228
You can't tell me it's a
sure thing, can you?

1120
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:09,519
Oh, Frankie.

1121
01:01:09,728 --> 01:01:11,519
Deal for Schwiefka, like always?

1122
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:13,519
Forget this "great job"!

1123
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:15,436
I quit dealing, Zosch.

1124
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:18,228
I can't take the chance, don't
you understand?

1125
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,394
If the joint gets raided and
I get picked up again...

1126
01:01:20,436 --> 01:01:21,894
...Mr Lane would be through with me.

1127
01:01:22,103 --> 01:01:23,894
And then how would I
play with a band?

1128
01:01:24,311 --> 01:01:27,061
How you gonna play if Schwiefka
gets ya arms broke?

1129
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:28,978
Goon

1130
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:30,519
Yeah - right here, he said it.

1131
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,811
And he wanted to slap
me around, too.

1132
01:01:33,728 --> 01:01:36,436
WHY CAN'T IT BE LIKE ALWAYS?!

1133
01:02:05,144 --> 01:02:05,853
Antek.

1134
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:15,644
You miserable piece of humanity.

1135
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,311
I got a right to quit if I want.

1136
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:20,353
Marquette and Williams are comin' tomorrow.
Don't you realise the significance?

1137
01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:21,311
Leave me alone.

1138
01:02:22,228 --> 01:02:24,061
I'll leave ya alone.

1139
01:02:24,394 --> 01:02:26,186
In the alley with the cats lookin'.

1140
01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:27,769
That's enough, Schwiefka.

1141
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:30,228
You don't wanna deal, you
don't wanna deal.

1142
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:31,603
What're you talkin' about
all of a sudden?

1143
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:34,436
Don't raise your voice
to me, you slob.

1144
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:37,811
He's no slave. You can't force him.
So what's the use?

1145
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:38,478
He, er---

1146
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:41,603
You had the best of him all these
years. Don't be a pig!

1147
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:44,519
Ain't interested. Right?

1148
01:02:45,103 --> 01:02:46,769
All right, all right.

1149
01:02:47,019 --> 01:02:49,353
Marquette and Williams, never heard of 'em.

1150
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,978
Money? Huh! Somethin' to blow ya nose on.

1151
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:53,978
I wash my hands.

1152
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,686
He's just a pig, is all.

1153
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:02,353
Still, you can't blame him so much.

1154
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:04,769
Lettin' the big ones get away, on
account of the best dealer...

1155
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:07,186
...in the business ain't workin'
for ya no more.

1156
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,186
That ain't easy to swallow.

1157
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,561
You're the best, all right.

1158
01:03:12,103 --> 01:03:14,936
The old squeeze play. Huh, Louie?

1159
01:03:15,894 --> 01:03:17,478
Been tried on you before, huh?

1160
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:20,269
Naw, I'm new around here.

1161
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:23,853
Are we really askin' so much,
Dealer? One night!

1162
01:03:24,144 --> 01:03:24,561
I like---

1163
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:28,644
You help us make a bundle. We'll spread a little
of that ol' sunshine around.

1164
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:30,769
Couldn't you use a couple of hundred?

1165
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:32,769
Maybe...

1166
01:03:32,978 --> 01:03:34,353
...two-five-oh?

1167
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:35,978
Huh?

1168
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,894
Two-five-oh pays a lot of
doctor bills, Dealer.

1169
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:43,394
Tomorrow, huh?

1170
01:03:43,728 --> 01:03:45,853
- Frankie, I---
- Let him make up his mind.

1171
01:03:48,478 --> 01:03:49,228
Okay.

1172
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:51,436
But for one night!

1173
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,978
Win or lose, sun-up I case the deck.

1174
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:55,644
Sure, you're the dealer.

1175
01:03:55,728 --> 01:03:57,936
What a load off! Now I can sleep.

1176
01:03:58,686 --> 01:04:00,269
Take care of that arm.

1177
01:04:02,686 --> 01:04:04,561
The character, huh?

1178
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:10,228
Were you jackin' up the price just now,
or do you really have this music job?

1179
01:04:13,644 --> 01:04:15,436
If they like what they hear.

1180
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,144
<i>Chance-y, huh'?</i>

1181
01:04:20,936 --> 01:04:21,853
Nervous?

1182
01:04:25,144 --> 01:04:26,478
So what are we waitin' for?

1183
01:04:26,686 --> 01:04:28,728
Don't talk about it. It's tough enough!

1184
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:30,728
I know, I know.

1185
01:04:31,353 --> 01:04:33,103
I put down a cravin' once.

1186
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:34,728
No.

1187
01:04:35,686 --> 01:04:37,269
Candy - sweets.

1188
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,269
I used to be eatin' it all the time.

1189
01:04:39,811 --> 01:04:42,978
Got examined for the army. They said
"You got sugar in your blood, friend."

1190
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:46,061
"You gotta give up sweets forever,
or it's 'goodbye Charlie'."

1191
01:04:47,769 --> 01:04:50,228
I had to give up candy.

1192
01:04:50,603 --> 01:04:52,478
My gums bleed for ya!

1193
01:04:52,644 --> 01:04:53,478
It's awful.

1194
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:55,478
It was.

1195
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:58,853
That unfinished feelin'
you got all the time.

1196
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:01,894
- Well, I don't have to tell you.
- So don't!

1197
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:05,436
I mean, you got this one thing
on the mind, all the time.

1198
01:05:06,228 --> 01:05:07,644
Can't stop thinkin' about it.

1199
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:09,728
You're just a mine of
information, ain't ya?

1200
01:05:09,769 --> 01:05:11,728
You know what I did?

1201
01:05:11,728 --> 01:05:12,769
I said to myself...

1202
01:05:13,061 --> 01:05:15,186
"Okay - off sweets, forever."

1203
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:17,769
Well... "forever" can start tomorrow.

1204
01:05:18,186 --> 01:05:19,769
For once in my life...

1205
01:05:19,853 --> 01:05:22,644
...I'm gonna eat all the candy
that I can hold.

1206
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:27,269
I bought eighteen dollars and twenty three cents'
worth of candy, lugged it up to my room.

1207
01:05:27,603 --> 01:05:29,811
All night long, I ate candy.

1208
01:05:32,853 --> 01:05:34,144
I was sick.

1209
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:35,853
I was sweatin'.

1210
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,853
But I kept shovin' it in.

1211
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:40,811
Ever since then...

1212
01:05:40,894 --> 01:05:42,603
...when I feel like candy, I say to myself...

1213
01:05:42,686 --> 01:05:44,769
..."Well, you can't complain, brother."

1214
01:05:44,936 --> 01:05:47,478
"You once had it - and had it good."

1215
01:05:50,436 --> 01:05:51,769
You know what I mean?

1216
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:56,644
Huh?

1217
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:37,686
How's it, Molly-o?

1218
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:40,228
I'm all right, thank you - but
where ya been?

1219
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:43,061
What'll ya have?
Coupl'a ryes.

1220
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:46,978
All day I was expectin' ya'd
be in to practise.

1221
01:06:47,186 --> 01:06:47,728
Practise!

1222
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:49,728
I'll get down there and knock 'em dead.

1223
01:06:49,811 --> 01:06:52,103
It's all in the wrist, and I
got the touch, Molly.

1224
01:06:52,561 --> 01:06:53,853
Look at that - steady as a rock.

1225
01:06:54,019 --> 01:06:55,561
It'll do anything I want it to do.

1226
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:01,061
Keep the change, pal.

1227
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:02,644
Thanks.

1228
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,686
You got a cigarette, Frankie?

1229
01:07:06,478 --> 01:07:07,061
Sure.

1230
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:24,436
You're on it again, Frankie.

1231
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:26,436
Why? Why?

1232
01:07:27,186 --> 01:07:28,769
No, now listen, Molly.

1233
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:29,561
Listen.

1234
01:07:29,936 --> 01:07:31,103
- Why?
- Molly.

1235
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:32,519
Molly.

1236
01:07:32,811 --> 01:07:33,769
- Not now.
- Beat it!

1237
01:07:33,978 --> 01:07:35,394
Molly, I... I only want to talk.

1238
01:07:35,394 --> 01:07:36,478
- Take a walk.
- Don't.

1239
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,019
Molly, listen to me. I can explain.

1240
01:07:38,061 --> 01:07:39,228
Molly, I just wanna talk.

1241
01:07:39,228 --> 01:07:39,978
Will ya get outta here?

1242
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:41,269
Please. Stop!

1243
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:41,936
- Molly.
- Molly, listen.

1244
01:07:41,978 --> 01:07:43,728
- Please, will you let me---
- Please, don't hurt him, will you?

1245
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:45,144
Go away!

1246
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:51,769
Are you lookin' to lose your job? Can't
you manage a customer?

1247
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:52,769
- Molly, listen to me.
- Let me go.

1248
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:54,561
- I gotta talk to you.
- Leave me, the both of you.

1249
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:57,144
Let me go, both of ya.
I can't stand it no more!

1250
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:57,769
Molly!

1251
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:19,853
Molly! Molly! Molly!

1252
01:08:22,603 --> 01:08:24,394
Molly, listen to me.

1253
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,394
Molly, open the door!

1254
01:08:30,144 --> 01:08:31,853
Molly, will ya open the door?

1255
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:35,978
Molly! Molly!

1256
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:38,269
Let me talk to ya, Molly.

1257
01:08:44,103 --> 01:08:44,769
Molly!

1258
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:47,436
Molly, open the door.

1259
01:08:57,561 --> 01:09:00,353
Molly! Honey“

1260
01:09:02,144 --> 01:09:03,686
Where ya goin', Molly?

1261
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:05,686
Tell me - where ya goin', Molly?

1262
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:08,603
Taxi!

1263
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,228
If you let me explain, you'll
know why I did it.

1264
01:09:10,228 --> 01:09:10,644
Taxi!

1265
01:09:10,728 --> 01:09:12,478
Molly, listen, would ya, please?

1266
01:09:12,603 --> 01:09:14,061
Let me tell ya what happened.

1267
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,686
Where ya goin', Molly?

1268
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:17,686
Tell me, where ya goin'?

1269
01:09:18,061 --> 01:09:19,061
No, Molly!

1270
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:21,061
Molly!

1271
01:10:03,269 --> 01:10:04,728
Don't forget to clean
out the gaboon.

1272
01:10:04,728 --> 01:10:06,103
I already cleaned it.

1273
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,186
And say please when
ya talk to me, or I'll...

1274
01:10:08,228 --> 01:10:10,561
...buy a gaboon, and go into
business for myself.

1275
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:12,103
How's that, Frankie?

1276
01:10:12,478 --> 01:10:13,561
Nuthin' huh? Well, well.

1277
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:17,561
I'm reminding ya, Schwiefka.

1278
01:10:18,353 --> 01:10:20,311
I get two, two and a half. Maybe more.

1279
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:22,311
Would I go back on my word?

1280
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,978
How ya feelin', Dealer?

1281
01:10:34,978 --> 01:10:35,894
Hiya, Schwiefka.

1282
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:37,436
Ah, big night, tonight.

1283
01:10:50,894 --> 01:10:51,686
Yeah?

1284
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:52,603
This the place?

1285
01:10:52,769 --> 01:10:54,478
I don't know what place ya mean, Buddy.

1286
01:10:54,478 --> 01:10:56,769
This is the Ellis Belt and Leather Company.

1287
01:10:56,894 --> 01:10:58,769
Ya wanna buy a Ellis belt?

1288
01:10:59,103 --> 01:11:00,644
Come right in. We're just startin'.

1289
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:02,269
- How ya been?
- Fine, how are you?

1290
01:11:02,353 --> 01:11:03,186
Pretty good.

1291
01:11:04,478 --> 01:11:06,103
I could handle the door
better if I was blind.

1292
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:08,936
Go on, you couldn't heat towels
for a scared barber.

1293
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:10,603
You know Schwiefka?

1294
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:12,228
Oh, sure. Glad to have ya.

1295
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:13,394
- Hi.
- Hi.

1296
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:14,811
You Machine?

1297
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:17,311
"Man with the Golden Arm", huh?

1298
01:11:17,436 --> 01:11:20,353
Aah! Let's see ya try and
take this away.

1299
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:34,394
Here we go, down and dirty.

1300
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:59,811
No ladies allowed -
you know that, Vi.

1301
01:11:59,978 --> 01:12:02,478
- Is Frankie in there?
- What's the matter?

1302
01:12:02,603 --> 01:12:05,061
Zosch - I can't get her to sleep.

1303
01:12:05,394 --> 01:12:07,936
She and Frankie had an argument,
and she's almost out of her mind.

1304
01:12:08,186 --> 01:12:08,686
Is he in there?

1305
01:12:08,686 --> 01:12:09,853
Well, I can't call him now.

1306
01:12:09,894 --> 01:12:11,853
Well, I just want to know he's here.

1307
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:14,478
I been bouncin' around 12th Street
like a pool ball.

1308
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:15,603
He's here. He's here.

1309
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:16,978
I gotta get back in.

1310
01:12:17,144 --> 01:12:19,269
Well, tell him she's worried,
ya get a chance.

1311
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:20,061
Yeah.

1312
01:12:24,269 --> 01:12:25,311
Three aces.

1313
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:26,478
Two pairs.

1314
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:28,186
Possible straight flush.

1315
01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:29,978
- Aces.
- Two hundred.

1316
01:12:30,269 --> 01:12:32,269
I call it two hundred.
And I'll raise it two.

1317
01:12:34,311 --> 01:12:35,853
I'll have a look for four hundred.

1318
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,853
And the house bumps ya,
three hundred more.

1319
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:39,853
Up to you, Aces.

1320
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:43,019
I don't know. I... I just don't know.

1321
01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:44,728
You got three aces showin'.

1322
01:12:44,978 --> 01:12:47,644
He's got a possible straight
flush to the Queen showin'.

1323
01:12:47,686 --> 01:12:49,644
I tell ya, he's bluff in'.

1324
01:12:49,686 --> 01:12:51,644
I think he bluffed me outta
a couple tonight.

1325
01:12:52,144 --> 01:12:54,561
You wouldn't be jerk enough to
try it again, would ya?

1326
01:12:55,686 --> 01:12:56,936
Bet and find out.

1327
01:12:57,353 --> 01:12:59,519
Well, bet, bet, I tell ya -
he's a bluff-artist.

1328
01:13:00,769 --> 01:13:01,519
Call.

1329
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:03,853
I call it.

1330
01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:05,436
An' I raise it five hundred more.

1331
01:13:05,478 --> 01:13:07,436
- Sammy!
- I know what I'm doin'.

1332
01:13:09,353 --> 01:13:10,603
I'll have a look.

1333
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,436
And the house bumps ya,
five hundred more.

1334
01:13:15,894 --> 01:13:17,478
I told ya. I told ya he had it.

1335
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,478
Shut up will ya, and let me think?

1336
01:13:20,061 --> 01:13:21,478
It's up to you.

1337
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:23,478
What's the rush, I wanna know?

1338
01:13:24,811 --> 01:13:26,353
Your bet, two pairs.

1339
01:13:27,728 --> 01:13:29,936
I heard ya, I heard ya. What is this,
a forced joint or somethin'?

1340
01:13:29,936 --> 01:13:31,644
A man's got a right to
study his hand.

1341
01:13:31,894 --> 01:13:33,394
Bet or fold!

1342
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:36,353
Use ya head, Sammy. I tell ya he's got it.

1343
01:13:36,353 --> 01:13:39,103
- Don't throw good money after bad.
- I know what I'm doin'.

1344
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:51,269
What'd ya have?

1345
01:13:52,436 --> 01:13:54,478
You didn't pay to find out.

1346
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:55,936
Nothin'!

1347
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:57,853
Two lousy nines.

1348
01:13:57,936 --> 01:14:01,186
You let him bluff ya out of a full
house with a lousy two nines?

1349
01:14:01,978 --> 01:14:03,978
You do that again at this table,
and you're through.

1350
01:14:04,811 --> 01:14:06,728
Ah, forget it this once, Dealer.

1351
01:14:06,853 --> 01:14:08,311
He paid plenty for it.

1352
01:14:11,728 --> 01:14:13,811
You're good, Dealer.
Maybe too good.

1353
01:14:14,894 --> 01:14:16,228
Whaddya mean by that?

1354
01:14:17,478 --> 01:14:19,728
Cut the talk. Deal... deal.

1355
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:21,728
Punk, get some of the
smoke outta here.

1356
01:14:23,311 --> 01:14:24,853
What do ya mean, "too good."?

1357
01:14:24,978 --> 01:14:26,853
If the shoe fits, brother.

1358
01:14:31,603 --> 01:14:33,061
I'm casing the deck. It's daylight.

1359
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:33,894
What?

1360
01:14:34,228 --> 01:14:35,436
Tell him to sit down and deal.

1361
01:14:35,686 --> 01:14:37,811
Well, we always break
up around now.

1362
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:38,853
One more round.

1363
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:39,561
How about my money.

1364
01:14:39,644 --> 01:14:41,561
Let's have Dealer back in the slot?

1365
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:44,311
- Frankie, how 'bout it'?
- Nope.

1366
01:14:44,478 --> 01:14:45,311
Just give me what's comin' to me.

1367
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:46,519
One more hour, huh?

1368
01:14:46,561 --> 01:14:47,228
I'll deal.

1369
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:49,436
You? We wanna play Machine.

1370
01:14:49,644 --> 01:14:51,769
Oh, you think I can't sell ya
a thing or two, huh?

1371
01:14:51,811 --> 01:14:52,978
Siddown - we'll get goin'.

1372
01:14:52,978 --> 01:14:54,228
- How 'bout my dough?
- Soon as we break.

1373
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:55,103
Now!

1374
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:58,311
Give us a chance to count it at least.
Go home, you'll get it later.

1375
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:00,394
Okay, ante up. Here we go.

1376
01:15:00,478 --> 01:15:01,478
A hundred it is.

1377
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:03,978
Yeah, a hundred.

1378
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:07,228
Okay, here we go.

1379
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:48,728
Good morning, Frankie.

1380
01:17:10,394 --> 01:17:10,978
Frankie!

1381
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,019
Is Louie still here?

1382
01:17:12,019 --> 01:17:16,019
He's havin' an appleplexy. What they're
doin' to Schwiefka in there!

1383
01:17:17,186 --> 01:17:18,853
We're gettin' murdered - you
gotta take the slot.

1384
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:19,686
I ain't here for dealin'.

1385
01:17:19,894 --> 01:17:22,144
Look. You gotta make it stop, Louie.

1386
01:17:22,269 --> 01:17:23,519
No deal, no fix.

1387
01:17:23,561 --> 01:17:24,853
Well, give me my money and
I'll go see someone else---

1388
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,644
I can't give you your money now!
The house needs every cent.

1389
01:17:26,686 --> 01:17:27,644
You owe it to me!

1390
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,644
- Take me to court.
- Please, Louie.

1391
01:17:29,644 --> 01:17:30,978
You gotta make it stop.

1392
01:17:31,061 --> 01:17:32,269
I'll take care of you.

1393
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:33,394
Just work a few hours.

1394
01:17:33,394 --> 01:17:35,853
I gotta get some sleep. I gotta
be fresh tomorrow.

1395
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:36,978
Work a few hours.

1396
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:39,561
Do us a favour. I'll guarantee you'll
feel like a week in the country.

1397
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:41,228
Please, Louie, please - now.

1398
01:17:41,394 --> 01:17:42,603
Drop dead!

1399
01:17:42,686 --> 01:17:44,061
Please. Wait a second.

1400
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:47,353
Okay.

1401
01:17:51,769 --> 01:17:53,228
Louie says ya got money for him.

1402
01:17:53,561 --> 01:17:54,561
Gimme. He's waitin'!

1403
01:17:54,686 --> 01:17:55,311
Sparrow?

1404
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:55,936
Yeah, yeah.

1405
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:57,019
Yeah, I know he's waitin'.

1406
01:17:57,103 --> 01:18:00,144
So I seen this one and that one, and
they all say the same thing.

1407
01:18:00,394 --> 01:18:02,144
"Tell Louie like he tells us."

1408
01:18:02,228 --> 01:18:04,144
"Nothin' for nothin'."

1409
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:05,311
Not a penny?

1410
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:06,561
Not even.

1411
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:07,561
How is it up there?

1412
01:18:07,644 --> 01:18:08,353
What a game.

1413
01:18:08,478 --> 01:18:10,978
Schwiefka's meltin' away
like a dirty candle.

1414
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:12,644
The Dealer's losin', huh?

1415
01:18:12,769 --> 01:18:14,394
What's happened to that "golden arm"?

1416
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:17,769
Don't worry about the Dealer, the game's
just goin' on a day and a half.

1417
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:18,769
He'll come through.

1418
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:20,936
Why not, with those educated fingers.

1419
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:23,519
Now you see it - now you don't.

1420
01:18:24,103 --> 01:18:26,061
You keep your dirty mouth
off the Dealer.

1421
01:18:26,228 --> 01:18:27,561
Frankie runs a clean game.

1422
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,894
There ain't nothin' in the world
can make him change that.

1423
01:18:30,061 --> 01:18:30,811
Ach!

1424
01:18:33,311 --> 01:18:34,269
Hey, Antek.

1425
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:37,894
Deuce of hearts. Eight of spades.

1426
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:39,019
All right, all right.

1427
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:40,269
Six of hearts.

1428
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:41,978
Well, can you let me have a thousand?

1429
01:18:43,269 --> 01:18:44,894
How 'bout five hundred?

1430
01:18:45,019 --> 01:18:46,061
- Two hundred.
- Call.

1431
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:48,061
I know it's Sunday night.

1432
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:50,269
I didn't call you up to
find what day it is!

1433
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:52,269
House checks to you.

1434
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:53,728
Here - hold it a minute.

1435
01:18:53,978 --> 01:18:54,853
Here, hold it.

1436
01:18:59,936 --> 01:19:01,186
Gimme some of that!

1437
01:19:05,728 --> 01:19:07,561
I gotta get outta here, Louie. I'm dead.

1438
01:19:07,978 --> 01:19:09,394
I ain't slept in almost two days.

1439
01:19:09,436 --> 01:19:10,728
Just a little while, now.

1440
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:14,811
It ain't doin' ya any good.
The house is still losin'.

1441
01:19:15,144 --> 01:19:18,061
Stay with it, Dealer. The class is
beginning to tell. Just stay with it.

1442
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:20,019
I just can't. My head won't work no more.

1443
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:22,311
Louie, Louie. I'm runnin'
outta guys to call.

1444
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:24,311
- Lippy?
- Can't find him.

1445
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:25,686
I'll find him. He's loaded.

1446
01:19:25,728 --> 01:19:28,228
- I'm gettin' outta here.
- Just a little longer.

1447
01:19:28,811 --> 01:19:30,019
While I make a call.

1448
01:19:30,186 --> 01:19:32,019
Then I'll take you over to my place.

1449
01:19:39,269 --> 01:19:40,519
Ah, where were we. Who bets?

1450
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:42,728
House checks to you.

1451
01:19:42,769 --> 01:19:44,019
Okay, I'll bet a hundred.

1452
01:19:44,144 --> 01:19:44,728
Call me.

1453
01:20:03,978 --> 01:20:04,478
Coffee?

1454
01:20:04,686 --> 01:20:05,311
Good an' black.

1455
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:20,311
Schwiefka!

1456
01:20:22,853 --> 01:20:23,936
I can't raise another cent.

1457
01:20:24,478 --> 01:20:25,144
How's it goin'?

1458
01:20:25,228 --> 01:20:26,561
They're sluggin' us with their money.

1459
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:29,769
Every pot almost, they're raisin' and
raisin', until we're forced out.

1460
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:30,644
What day is it?

1461
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:33,353
Can't you think of anybody we
can tap for a few thousand?

1462
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:36,103
What day is it? Is it Monday yet?

1463
01:20:37,144 --> 01:20:38,186
Listen to me.

1464
01:20:39,228 --> 01:20:40,186
Are you listenin' to me?

1465
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:41,353
Why--- What?

1466
01:20:41,644 --> 01:20:42,936
Listen to me, I said.

1467
01:20:43,228 --> 01:20:47,019
The next big pot they try to force you out
with a raise - you gotta stay with 'em.

1468
01:20:47,144 --> 01:20:49,103
Schwiefka don't let me. He
keeps nudging me to fold.

1469
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,811
That's cause he ain't sure you'll win.

1470
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,019
You can't be sure.

1471
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:53,811
There's a way you can
be sure, all right.

1472
01:20:53,978 --> 01:20:55,936
You can do anything you
want with those cards.

1473
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:58,686
Ah, that's only for fun, I haven't
got nerve to do it for real.

1474
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,061
You wanna get outta here, don't ya?

1475
01:21:00,103 --> 01:21:00,394
What?

1476
01:21:00,436 --> 01:21:03,561
You wanna get to that try-out
in good condition, don't ya?

1477
01:21:03,853 --> 01:21:05,269
Yeah, I wanna get there feelin' good.

1478
01:21:05,269 --> 01:21:07,603
Well, you make sure - you
know what I mean?

1479
01:21:08,228 --> 01:21:09,603
Let's get on with the game.

1480
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,311
Let's get on with the game - I feel hot.

1481
01:21:11,478 --> 01:21:12,019
Yeah.

1482
01:21:16,103 --> 01:21:16,853
Wanna play again?

1483
01:21:16,936 --> 01:21:18,186
Yeah, might as well sit in one.

1484
01:21:20,186 --> 01:21:20,978
Okay, Dealer.

1485
01:21:43,519 --> 01:21:44,019
I'm in.

1486
01:21:44,186 --> 01:21:45,019
I'm in.

1487
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,103
Three. King.

1488
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:51,603
Jack.

1489
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:53,436
Queen bets a honey.

1490
01:21:54,936 --> 01:21:55,436
Call.

1491
01:21:56,519 --> 01:21:58,519
Ah... pair a treys.

1492
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:01,478
King, ten, Jack. seven. Pair of treys.

1493
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:03,353
I bet two hundred.

1494
01:22:03,478 --> 01:22:04,894
I call it two.

1495
01:22:06,186 --> 01:22:08,228
<i>House bets two.
Comm' out.</i>

1496
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:11,644
Pair of treys, pair of Kings,
pair of jacks.

1497
01:22:12,853 --> 01:22:13,894
I'm bettin' five hundred.

1498
01:22:18,394 --> 01:22:19,728
House sees.

1499
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,061
Call.

1500
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,019
<i>Comm' out.</i>

1501
01:22:25,019 --> 01:22:29,769
Three treys, Kings, Jacks, three treys.

1502
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:32,186
Three little treys bet five
hundred bucks.

1503
01:22:36,561 --> 01:22:39,269
Why, you! Cheatin', huh?

1504
01:22:51,936 --> 01:22:52,978
Take off your glasses.

1505
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:54,769
- No.
- Take 'em off!

1506
01:22:57,936 --> 01:23:01,394
- I didn't know, I didn't know!
- I'll get to you in a second.

1507
01:23:01,478 --> 01:23:03,728
I didn't know!!! This has never
happened before!

1508
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:06,561
Eleven years I've been runnin'
this game - ask anybody!

1509
01:23:09,269 --> 01:23:12,394
You don't deal for me no more.

1510
01:23:13,686 --> 01:23:15,228
You want him?

1511
01:23:15,978 --> 01:23:17,978
I wouldn't dirty my hands.

1512
01:23:19,103 --> 01:23:20,269
How was I to know?

1513
01:23:20,311 --> 01:23:22,603
You fellas, you fellas - do I
ever rig an honest game?

1514
01:23:22,686 --> 01:23:23,728
Tell 'em, tell em'.

1515
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:30,644
Frankie?

1516
01:23:34,269 --> 01:23:36,519
Everything's all right now, Frankie.

1517
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:47,436
Hey... Frankie... what's a little cuff in' around,
huh? Nothin'. Am I right?

1518
01:23:49,353 --> 01:23:55,894
You'll see - an hour from now we'll be in
Antek's, just laughin' about it.

1519
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:59,061
You shoulda seen Schwiefka's face...

1520
01:23:59,144 --> 01:24:02,228
...when Williams said he'll
"get to him in a minute".

1521
01:24:02,978 --> 01:24:06,478
He went white. It was so funny.

1522
01:24:07,353 --> 01:24:09,353
Cut it out, d'you hear?

1523
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:14,061
It was the best sport I knew,
my whole life.

1524
01:24:14,269 --> 01:24:15,769
Do you hear me?

1525
01:24:18,936 --> 01:24:20,644
Get away from me, punk.

1526
01:24:47,269 --> 01:24:49,269
- Hurry, quick.
- I wanna get to sleep.

1527
01:24:49,394 --> 01:24:50,394
Please - wait.

1528
01:24:50,978 --> 01:24:55,478
Beginning to wear off quick for you, ain't
it? You're graduating, student.

1529
01:24:55,728 --> 01:24:58,769
- You're gonna have to step it up.
- Anything. But, please - hurry.

1530
01:24:59,436 --> 01:25:03,228
All right.
Let's see your money.

1531
01:25:03,353 --> 01:25:04,603
Later, later.

1532
01:25:05,311 --> 01:25:06,144
Right now.

1533
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:09,644
- Trust me this once, will ya?
- You know I don't do that.

1534
01:25:09,728 --> 01:25:12,061
I'll pay you twice as much later, but I
gotta' do somethin' right now.

1535
01:25:12,144 --> 01:25:13,144
Beat it.

1536
01:25:13,728 --> 01:25:15,728
I'll even push for you, Louie. Hurry.

1537
01:25:16,269 --> 01:25:18,269
A flippin' junkie always says that.

1538
01:25:18,478 --> 01:25:20,811
Please, Louie - please. Please, Louie!

1539
01:25:20,894 --> 01:25:22,311
Get your dirty hands off!

1540
01:25:46,436 --> 01:25:47,353
Frankie.

1541
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:50,019
- Wake up! Get up!
- No, No.

1542
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,019
- Where'd you put it?
- Frankie. No!

1543
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:55,144
- No, no Frankie, let go.
- Where'd ya keep it!

1544
01:25:55,228 --> 01:25:57,978
I gotta find it. I can't find it!

1545
01:25:57,978 --> 01:26:01,436
Frankie, let me take you home. Frankie,
please - let me take ya home.

1546
01:26:01,519 --> 01:26:03,311
Frankie. Frankie, please!

1547
01:26:04,478 --> 01:26:07,478
I gotta be on time. I gotta be on time.

1548
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:14,603
Frankie.

1549
01:26:37,478 --> 01:26:40,936
Wow! What's the matter? Come on -
let's try to really cook it.

1550
01:26:41,644 --> 01:26:42,936
Mr Machine.

1551
01:26:43,144 --> 01:26:43,728
Mr Lane.

1552
01:26:43,769 --> 01:26:45,269
Okay, can you read music?

1553
01:26:45,311 --> 01:26:45,686
Yes.

1554
01:26:45,811 --> 01:26:48,561
Shelley - let Mr Machine
sit in on this one.

1555
01:26:52,478 --> 01:26:54,811
Number thirty-seven - it's
right in front of you.

1556
01:26:57,186 --> 01:26:59,228
You know it, Mr Machine?

1557
01:27:00,144 --> 01:27:04,144
Okay, let's try it.
One-two-three-four.

1558
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:07,144
Mr Machine - the first four bars is all you.

1559
01:27:07,228 --> 01:27:11,603
C'mon, let's try it again.
One-two-three-four.

1560
01:27:14,561 --> 01:27:15,811
I'm sorry.

1561
01:27:16,186 --> 01:27:22,186
Are you all set? Once again,
one-two-three-four!

1562
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:00,853
Okay, Shelley - let's go.

1563
01:28:32,436 --> 01:28:35,061
Zosch - do we have any money?
I need some money.

1564
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,103
No. What's the matter?

1565
01:28:37,686 --> 01:28:39,519
Some around here yesterday,
wasn't there?

1566
01:28:39,644 --> 01:28:40,769
I need some money, Zosch.

1567
01:28:40,853 --> 01:28:43,853
Well, there ain't any. What is
it, Frankie? What is it?

1568
01:29:30,644 --> 01:29:32,894
You can walk. Since when?

1569
01:29:38,978 --> 01:29:41,144
Well, what's the angle?

1570
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:45,061
What are you and Frankie
tryin' to pull?

1571
01:29:47,061 --> 01:29:49,978
Come on - tell me, one
hustler to another, huh?

1572
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,478
Go on - let me in on it?

1573
01:29:52,603 --> 01:29:54,728
Let me in on it or I'll queer
it for you, ya hear'?

1574
01:29:55,186 --> 01:29:57,936
I'll tell everybody you can walk -
you always could.

1575
01:29:58,186 --> 01:30:01,019
I'll tell 'em all you can walk -
you're a phoney!

1576
01:30:03,019 --> 01:30:09,394
No! Louie, Louie. Louie, no,
no - you can't do that.

1577
01:30:09,728 --> 01:30:11,894
You can't tell anybody! Please, Louie!

1578
01:30:11,978 --> 01:30:13,519
- Let me be!
- Please, Louie.

1579
01:30:13,603 --> 01:30:15,436
- Get your hands off.
- No!

1580
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:24,436
Don't touch him.
Call the police.

1581
01:31:11,561 --> 01:31:16,394
Molly! Molly! Molly!

1582
01:31:37,311 --> 01:31:39,103
Ain't that the way it happened?

1583
01:31:39,186 --> 01:31:42,978
They had a fight. Next thing anyone
knew, Louie was falling.

1584
01:31:43,769 --> 01:31:47,103
Come on - level, Zosch. Don't
tryta out-think me.

1585
01:31:47,228 --> 01:31:49,186
You'll only get tangled.

1586
01:31:49,811 --> 01:31:51,644
I don't know anythin' about a fight.

1587
01:31:52,019 --> 01:31:54,519
I... I was sleepin' all morning,
right here in this chair.

1588
01:31:54,853 --> 01:31:57,019
Then for all ya know, it
did happen that way?

1589
01:31:57,103 --> 01:31:59,561
While you was sleepin', Frankie
shoved him over.

1590
01:32:00,061 --> 01:32:01,311
He didn't.

1591
01:32:01,353 --> 01:32:03,561
How do you know, if you was sleepin'?

1592
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:08,144
It wasn't like I was sleepin' -
more like dozin', kinda'.

1593
01:32:08,228 --> 01:32:10,978
I'd have heard a fight
if there was one.

1594
01:32:11,769 --> 01:32:14,144
Frankie didn't do it - he
wasn't even here.

1595
01:32:14,519 --> 01:32:17,144
- When wasn't he here?
- When it happened.

1596
01:32:17,519 --> 01:32:20,686
How can you be sure
if you was dozin'?

1597
01:32:21,186 --> 01:32:24,144
I... I was up when he left, that's how
I'm sure I saw him go.

1598
01:32:24,978 --> 01:32:27,019
Then he was home this mornin'?

1599
01:32:27,978 --> 01:32:29,436
But only a second, honest.

1600
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:31,811
He didn't get in a fight. He
was here only a second.

1601
01:32:32,519 --> 01:32:35,394
Why didn't he stick around?
Was somebody after him?

1602
01:32:35,978 --> 01:32:39,478
Nobody was after him - nobody. He
just wanted some money, is all.

1603
01:32:39,478 --> 01:32:40,728
What for?

1604
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:42,353
I don't know what for.

1605
01:32:42,436 --> 01:32:45,686
A fix. He wanted it for a fix from Louie.

1606
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:47,936
It had nothing to do with Louie.

1607
01:32:48,811 --> 01:32:50,394
How do you know?

1608
01:32:50,686 --> 01:32:52,061
'Cos there was no money.

1609
01:32:52,186 --> 01:32:55,519
Why would he want to see Louie for a
fix, if he didn't have no money?

1610
01:32:55,644 --> 01:32:57,728
To try and get one without money.

1611
01:32:59,769 --> 01:33:02,519
Okay, I can wait. Wherever he is...

1612
01:33:02,561 --> 01:33:05,061
...sooner or later, he's gotta'
come out for a fix.

1613
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:15,186
Molly. Molly, wait, please.

1614
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:17,436
It's finished, Frankie - like I told ya.

1615
01:33:17,644 --> 01:33:20,186
I gotta talk to you, Molly. Please.

1616
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:22,811
No, once and for all.

1617
01:33:24,478 --> 01:33:30,228
I gotta talk to you. Got any money,
Molly? I need a few dollars.

1618
01:33:30,436 --> 01:33:32,061
Ten dollars would do it.

1619
01:33:32,228 --> 01:33:37,811
I'll get it back to you in a few days.
Or five, even. Five would be fine.

1620
01:33:37,894 --> 01:33:44,353
Please. I feel so sick, Molly. I... I
hurt all over, I feel so bad.

1621
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:50,394
Don't say no, please don't say no.
Why not, Molly? Why not?

1622
01:33:51,019 --> 01:33:54,644
Jump off a roof if you gonna kill yourself,
but don't ask me to help ya.

1623
01:33:55,811 --> 01:34:01,269
I'll do anything for you, Molly, but... but
right now you gotta help me.

1624
01:34:01,311 --> 01:34:03,811
I... I need a shot.

1625
01:34:03,853 --> 01:34:04,644
No!

1626
01:34:05,894 --> 01:34:11,103
Five would do it, or... three or two,
even - but please, hurry.

1627
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:13,853
You mustn't take that
dirty stuff no more!

1628
01:34:13,853 --> 01:34:16,853
I know, I know - you're right...
and I promise.

1629
01:34:17,478 --> 01:34:18,728
But right now I need a fix.

1630
01:34:18,769 --> 01:34:21,769
Just one fix - to help me stop hurtin'.

1631
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:24,769
And then I promise you I'll
kick it for good.

1632
01:34:24,769 --> 01:34:26,353
Just a few dollars, Molly? Please!

1633
01:34:32,811 --> 01:34:36,144
Hello, Molly. I just wanted
to come say "hello".

1634
01:34:37,019 --> 01:34:38,186
Ain't ya gonna let me in?

1635
01:34:38,561 --> 01:34:41,019
I asked you please not to
bother me no more.

1636
01:34:41,394 --> 01:34:42,686
I... I miss you.

1637
01:34:43,769 --> 01:34:45,436
Look - I'm awfully tired, Johnny.

1638
01:34:45,478 --> 01:34:47,311
I'll stay only a few minutes.

1639
01:34:47,769 --> 01:34:48,353
No.

1640
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:51,811
Who's in there with you?

1641
01:34:53,519 --> 01:34:54,644
Go away, Johnny - and don't come back.

1642
01:34:54,686 --> 01:34:57,686
Who is it? Not the Dealer? You
ain't hidin' him, are ya?

1643
01:34:58,478 --> 01:35:00,644
You wouldn't be dumb enough to
be an accessory, would you?

1644
01:35:00,978 --> 01:35:02,394
What do you mean, "accessory"?

1645
01:35:02,728 --> 01:35:03,894
He killed Louie.

1646
01:35:04,144 --> 01:35:05,853
Cops are lookin' for him this minute!

1647
01:35:06,436 --> 01:35:07,811
Frankie Machine?

1648
01:35:09,019 --> 01:35:10,061
Is he in there?

1649
01:35:11,353 --> 01:35:11,728
No.

1650
01:35:12,311 --> 01:35:13,144
I'm comin' in.

1651
01:35:13,186 --> 01:35:15,228
Not if you ever want
to see me again.

1652
01:35:15,978 --> 01:35:17,519
Will you meet me tomorrow?

1653
01:35:18,811 --> 01:35:21,061
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be around Antek's.

1654
01:35:21,228 --> 01:35:22,853
Maybe not tomorrow - but soon.

1655
01:35:23,019 --> 01:35:24,019
I miss ya.

1656
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:36,228
Honest, I... I didn't.

1657
01:35:39,644 --> 01:35:41,103
What am I gonna do?

1658
01:35:42,686 --> 01:35:44,394
Go tell Bednar it wasn't you.

1659
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:50,728
L...l couldn't. I couldn't stand up
to the cops the way I am.

1660
01:35:52,478 --> 01:35:55,894
Look at me. I'd say anything they'd want
me to say, just for a shot.

1661
01:35:57,144 --> 01:35:58,186
Then get cured first.

1662
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:03,144
What are you talkin' about'? How am
I supposed to get cured?

1663
01:36:03,353 --> 01:36:04,686
You did it once.

1664
01:36:05,728 --> 01:36:08,186
That was with help and
medicine - and doctors.

1665
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,811
I can't go applying to Lexington with a
murder hangin' over my head.

1666
01:36:14,061 --> 01:36:15,936
Couldn't you do it without goin' there?

1667
01:36:18,353 --> 01:36:19,644
You mean just stop?

1668
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:22,228
Cold turkey?

1669
01:36:23,894 --> 01:36:27,186
You don't understand,
the... pain.

1670
01:36:28,103 --> 01:36:29,603
What else can you do?

1671
01:36:30,728 --> 01:36:33,394
All I need is one shot - just one.

1672
01:36:35,728 --> 01:36:36,936
All right!

1673
01:36:42,894 --> 01:36:44,561
It's here - take it.

1674
01:36:45,353 --> 01:36:46,728
Go on and take it all.

1675
01:36:48,728 --> 01:36:52,603
'Cos all that you're gonna need after
that one shot - is another.

1676
01:36:53,019 --> 01:36:54,894
And then another, and then another.

1677
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:56,478
Take it!

1678
01:36:58,186 --> 01:36:58,894
Take it!

1679
01:37:00,978 --> 01:37:03,144
Why should you hurt like
other people hurt?

1680
01:37:05,186 --> 01:37:08,186
Yes, so you had a dog's life,
with never a break.

1681
01:37:09,644 --> 01:37:12,019
Why try to face it - like
most people do?

1682
01:37:12,853 --> 01:37:15,436
No - just roll up all your pains...

1683
01:37:15,478 --> 01:37:19,436
...into one big hurt - and then
flatten it with a fix.

1684
01:37:21,936 --> 01:37:24,519
What d'ya think you'll find
just outside that door?

1685
01:37:27,769 --> 01:37:31,103
Don't ya think that Bednar
knows what ya are...

1686
01:37:31,228 --> 01:37:35,228
...and what ya need... just to get
through that next hour?

1687
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:41,269
Don't ya know he's just waitin'
for ya to come and get it?

1688
01:37:45,269 --> 01:37:47,686
Go on! Let him kill ya!

1689
01:37:50,269 --> 01:37:53,686
Let him kill ya! It'll be quicker and
better than doin' it your way.

1690
01:38:00,561 --> 01:38:01,019
No.

1691
01:38:04,311 --> 01:38:05,269
No.

1692
01:38:07,894 --> 01:38:09,728
I won't let him kill me.

1693
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:12,769
No.

1694
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:17,978
And I won't run into no grave.

1695
01:38:22,644 --> 01:38:24,436
But... kickin' it?!

1696
01:38:27,936 --> 01:38:31,936
Look... a guy can't do it by himself.

1697
01:38:35,936 --> 01:38:36,936
<i>I'll</i> help.

1698
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:43,728
You know what you're
letting yourself in for?

1699
01:38:44,811 --> 01:38:48,061
It ain't pretty... and it could
be dangerous.

1700
01:38:50,144 --> 01:38:52,478
If they find ya here, then
they find ya, is all.

1701
01:38:53,686 --> 01:38:58,311
I don't mean dangerous from Bednar.
I mean dangerous from me.

1702
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:07,561
Sometimes a junkie will... kill to get
away from the treatment.

1703
01:39:08,728 --> 01:39:09,519
Understand?

1704
01:39:12,311 --> 01:39:14,269
So if you've got any knives
or scissors in the house...

1705
01:39:14,311 --> 01:39:16,728
...you've gotta... put 'em
away for a while.

1706
01:39:18,311 --> 01:39:19,978
And don't let me out of the room.

1707
01:39:20,894 --> 01:39:24,728
No matter what I say or promise -
or how much I beg.

1708
01:39:25,853 --> 01:39:29,603
Because if I get out, it'll only be
to go out and find a fix.

1709
01:39:30,603 --> 01:39:32,603
That's the way it is, ya understand?

1710
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:34,394
Just lock me in the room.

1711
01:39:35,394 --> 01:39:38,228
And if I try to make a break for it, stop
me any way ya know how.

1712
01:39:39,269 --> 01:39:41,269
No matter how much
you see it hurtin' me...

1713
01:39:41,853 --> 01:39:45,519
...don't try to help me with pills or dope
or anything else like that.

1714
01:39:48,936 --> 01:39:51,311
D'you think you can handle it...?

1715
01:40:10,561 --> 01:40:11,603
Here we go...

1716
01:40:13,686 --> 01:40:14,686
...down and dirty.

1717
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:23,144
You can't hold me. You're commitin'
double jeopardy or somethin'.

1718
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:25,728
Siddown.

1719
01:40:26,936 --> 01:40:29,894
You can't hold me.
You can't hold me.

1720
01:40:29,978 --> 01:40:32,978
I ain't got all my marbles -
you know that, Captain.

1721
01:40:32,978 --> 01:40:36,519
Right - down to cases, Sparrow.
And quit horsin' around.

1722
01:40:36,853 --> 01:40:38,103
I didn't do nothin'.

1723
01:40:38,269 --> 01:40:41,894
Frankie did somethin', all right - and I
want you to tell me about it.

1724
01:40:42,311 --> 01:40:45,478
Whoever killed that peddler should
get a tickertape parade!

1725
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:49,644
Yeah, and maybe I'd lead the band - but
I still want ya to tell me about it.

1726
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:53,728
Listen to me, Sparrow - when we
catch him, he stands trial...

1727
01:40:54,103 --> 01:40:56,686
...whether you talk or whether you don't.

1728
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:01,769
The only question is - do I ticket
you as an accessory?

1729
01:41:03,103 --> 01:41:05,353
Bednar - don't nail me to the cross.

1730
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:07,811
He's the only guy I ever
had for a friend.

1731
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:09,936
He's nobody's friend anymore.

1732
01:41:10,186 --> 01:41:14,228
He'd mash you with a steamroller if you
got between him and a pop in the arm.

1733
01:41:15,978 --> 01:41:18,144
Come on - talk, Sparrow.

1734
01:41:22,436 --> 01:41:24,186
Okay - beat it.

1735
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:00,061
Doc...

1736
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:02,519
...Lennox!

1737
01:42:48,978 --> 01:42:51,978
DRAMATIC MUSIC]

1738
01:43:24,478 --> 01:43:25,978
Lemme out!

1739
01:43:35,103 --> 01:43:36,728
Come on, Moll!!!
C'mon!!

1740
01:44:00,353 --> 01:44:00,728
Yes?

1741
01:44:09,978 --> 01:44:11,978
I thought I'd come see how
you've been, Zosch.

1742
01:44:12,144 --> 01:44:13,519
Alone - that's how I've been.

1743
01:44:15,686 --> 01:44:17,603
Something to eat - sausage.

1744
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:24,561
Alone and worried sick. Where is he?
You know where he is?

1745
01:44:25,186 --> 01:44:26,144
Did he go to you?

1746
01:44:28,894 --> 01:44:30,228
Whaddya want, anyway?

1747
01:44:31,728 --> 01:44:34,478
Zosch, what you told Bednar.
You've seen the papers.

1748
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:37,269
You see how bad it makes Frankie
look, what ya said.

1749
01:44:37,478 --> 01:44:41,811
I didn't tell Bednar anything. The papers -
they twist everything all up.

1750
01:44:42,311 --> 01:44:44,728
They wouldn't be able to
if ya didn't let them.

1751
01:44:44,769 --> 01:44:46,228
I can't help what they do.

1752
01:44:46,728 --> 01:44:48,644
Whaddya expect me to do, sittin' here?

1753
01:44:49,811 --> 01:44:52,228
Just tell Bednar that Frankie wasn't
here when it happened.

1754
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:53,311
That he didn't do it.

1755
01:44:53,811 --> 01:44:55,144
I never said he did.

1756
01:44:55,978 --> 01:44:59,144
But that's how it sounds, if he was the
only one around at the time!

1757
01:45:00,019 --> 01:45:02,019
And you know it was somebody else.

1758
01:45:03,144 --> 01:45:05,144
What do you mean? Who?

1759
01:45:06,061 --> 01:45:08,811
I don't know, but maybe Bednar
could figure it out...

1760
01:45:08,853 --> 01:45:10,269
...if he didn't think it was Frankie.

1761
01:45:10,478 --> 01:45:12,186
What business is it of yours, anyway?

1762
01:45:12,728 --> 01:45:14,728
I just wanna help, that's all.

1763
01:45:15,478 --> 01:45:16,894
Who are you kiddin'?

1764
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:19,394
You think I don't know
what you really want.

1765
01:45:20,144 --> 01:45:22,811
You think I don't know what you and him
have been up to behind my back...

1766
01:45:22,853 --> 01:45:24,644
...while I've had to sit here
all these years?

1767
01:45:25,228 --> 01:45:27,769
Had to sit here all these years!

1768
01:45:27,811 --> 01:45:29,186
No, Zosch - you got it wrong.

1769
01:45:29,228 --> 01:45:31,978
No - you got it wrong! 'Cos
you'll never get him.

1770
01:45:32,228 --> 01:45:35,811
He put me in this chair - and as long
as I sit here he'll never leave me.

1771
01:45:36,228 --> 01:45:37,728
He knows he belongs to me.

1772
01:45:37,769 --> 01:45:41,769
- No, Zosch, I come here only to help.
- I wouldn't want to live if he left me.

1773
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:44,811
And I'd rather see him dead, too,
than have him go to you.

1774
01:45:44,853 --> 01:45:45,394
Zosch, please.

1775
01:45:45,394 --> 01:45:46,478
Get outta here!

1776
01:45:46,936 --> 01:45:49,019
Get outta here, ya lousy tramp!

1777
01:45:49,603 --> 01:45:50,228
Get out!

1778
01:45:51,269 --> 01:45:52,519
Get out!!!

1779
01:46:55,061 --> 01:46:56,561
Frankie, no!

1780
01:46:58,311 --> 01:47:00,603
I can't stand it any longer.

1781
01:47:00,769 --> 01:47:03,978
- Just a little longer.
- Please help me'? Keep me warm.

1782
01:47:04,228 --> 01:47:05,519
I can't stand it.

1783
01:47:09,811 --> 01:47:12,353
I gotta get out... and get a fix.

1784
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:15,686
Open the door, Molly - do like I say.

1785
01:47:16,019 --> 01:47:18,561
Open the door or I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

1786
01:47:18,603 --> 01:47:21,686
- Frankie, listen. If you really---
- I can't, I can't!

1787
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:23,936
Then I do have something put
away to make it stop.

1788
01:47:23,978 --> 01:47:26,186
Gimme, quick. Gimme, quick!

1789
01:47:27,936 --> 01:47:29,728
Where?! I'll get it.

1790
01:47:36,686 --> 01:47:42,019
Molly! Molly, open the door! Let
me out! Out! Out!

1791
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:43,853
Out, out, out!!

1792
01:47:43,894 --> 01:47:49,186
Molly, open the door!
Please Molly! Molly! Molly!

1793
01:48:00,228 --> 01:48:00,811
Frankie?

1794
01:48:02,019 --> 01:48:03,186
Frankie, answer me.

1795
01:48:11,686 --> 01:48:13,769
Frankie, answer me.
Are ya all right?

1796
01:48:15,353 --> 01:48:18,311
Don't think you can fool me into opening
this door, 'cause I'm not gonna.

1797
01:48:19,978 --> 01:48:22,519
Are y'all right, Frankie?
Please answer me.

1798
01:48:33,311 --> 01:48:38,269
Molly... Molly - if you love me,
kill me. Please.

1799
01:48:38,603 --> 01:48:41,228
Oh, I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

1800
01:48:42,644 --> 01:48:43,519
So cold.

1801
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:48,144
Make me warm, please?

1802
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:51,103
Oh, please warm me.

1803
01:48:53,186 --> 01:48:54,061
Molly...

1804
01:48:59,603 --> 01:49:01,519
Please, Molly - make me warm.

1805
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:09,269
Oh, Molly - I'm so c-c-cold.

1806
01:49:11,978 --> 01:49:13,269
Make me warm?

1807
01:49:16,186 --> 01:49:17,603
Make me warm?

1808
01:49:21,478 --> 01:49:23,561
Oh, God, God. Please, God.

1809
01:49:24,061 --> 01:49:26,311
Please make me warm, Molly.

1810
01:49:28,228 --> 01:49:30,561
I'm so c-c-cold.

1811
01:49:33,186 --> 01:49:34,644
So cold.

1812
01:50:11,728 --> 01:50:13,644
I waited for ya at Antek's last night.

1813
01:50:13,686 --> 01:50:15,519
I told ya it might not be right away.

1814
01:50:15,644 --> 01:50:17,603
I... I thought maybe you were
sick or somethin'.

1815
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:21,519
I... I just wanna' tell ya - don't look
for me in Antek's no more.

1816
01:50:21,603 --> 01:50:24,061
He threw me out last night-
we had a little argument.

1817
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:25,561
So make it the Safari, huh?

1818
01:50:26,144 --> 01:50:28,353
Yeah. Sure, Johnny - sure.

1819
01:50:33,853 --> 01:50:35,186
Pretty good, huh, Molly?

1820
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:39,519
Take it slow, now.

1821
01:50:39,686 --> 01:50:42,436
Oh, I'm all right. Just a little rocky.

1822
01:50:58,894 --> 01:51:00,519
It's the most gorgeous day
I ever saw.

1823
01:51:02,228 --> 01:51:04,269
I think it's the first day
I ever saw.

1824
01:51:06,186 --> 01:51:07,811
I gotta craving for something sweet.

1825
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:09,019
You got anything sweet?

1826
01:51:10,144 --> 01:51:11,728
- Sugar.
- Gimme.

1827
01:51:18,603 --> 01:51:21,603
More. C'mon - more.

1828
01:51:24,519 --> 01:51:26,936
Ooh! How can you, Frankie?

1829
01:51:28,353 --> 01:51:30,478
Oh, I never felt this good in my life.

1830
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:35,269
I feel like all the things inside me
have settled into place.

1831
01:51:37,478 --> 01:51:38,478
Thanks, Molly.

1832
01:51:39,353 --> 01:51:40,311
Molly-o.

1833
01:51:41,978 --> 01:51:43,769
Look out - you'll scrape your face off.

1834
01:51:43,936 --> 01:51:44,978
I don't care.

1835
01:51:47,269 --> 01:51:50,978
- You got a razor I can use?
- Can I trust you with one?

1836
01:51:51,228 --> 01:51:52,228
Cross my heart.

1837
01:52:15,811 --> 01:52:17,811
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

1838
01:52:17,894 --> 01:52:18,686
Okay. Come on.

1839
01:52:18,686 --> 01:52:19,478
No, please.

1840
01:52:20,061 --> 01:52:21,978
You don't need me up there.

1841
01:52:42,103 --> 01:52:43,311
Where is he, Molly?

1842
01:52:43,686 --> 01:52:45,144
He didn't do it - honest.

1843
01:52:45,478 --> 01:52:48,269
I'm not a judge. They pay me
to bring 'em in, that's all.

1844
01:52:50,019 --> 01:52:51,061
If you tell me where he is...

1845
01:52:51,061 --> 01:52:53,519
...I promise he'll get every break
a junkie can get.

1846
01:52:53,728 --> 01:52:56,228
He's no junkie, either.
That's finished.

1847
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:57,728
Oh, sure - you bet.

1848
01:52:57,978 --> 01:52:58,978
See for yourself.

1849
01:52:59,728 --> 01:53:01,061
He ain't runnin' away from ya.

1850
01:53:01,811 --> 01:53:03,019
So, where is he?

1851
01:53:04,519 --> 01:53:05,353
With Zosch.

1852
01:53:06,644 --> 01:53:08,394
All right, Molly. Let's go see.

1853
01:53:19,728 --> 01:53:20,644
Hello, Zosch.

1854
01:53:21,728 --> 01:53:23,228
What are ya doin' here?

1855
01:53:23,644 --> 01:53:25,769
Frankie - don't you know
Bednar's lookin' for ya?

1856
01:53:26,186 --> 01:53:28,353
Don't worry about it, Zosch, I ain't afraid.

1857
01:53:28,811 --> 01:53:30,478
I didn't do it - you know that.

1858
01:53:31,436 --> 01:53:34,603
Who... Who did, then?
Who?

1859
01:53:35,353 --> 01:53:37,311
I come to tell ya somethin', Zosch.

1860
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:39,603
I'm leavin' here.

1861
01:53:39,728 --> 01:53:42,478
Bednar will arrest you. He told
the newspapers you---

1862
01:53:44,519 --> 01:53:45,144
What?

1863
01:53:46,811 --> 01:53:48,228
I'm leaving.

1864
01:53:49,519 --> 01:53:51,519
You won't have to worry about
money or anything;

1865
01:53:51,936 --> 01:53:53,936
I'll find a way to send you some regular.

1866
01:53:54,769 --> 01:53:56,228
And Vi'll take good care of ya.

1867
01:53:56,853 --> 01:53:57,769
Leaving me!?

1868
01:53:59,603 --> 01:54:01,478
Not leavin' you, Zosch -
just leavin'.

1869
01:54:04,186 --> 01:54:05,853
You saw what happened since I come back.

1870
01:54:06,728 --> 01:54:08,228
It's like Dr Lennox told me.

1871
01:54:09,603 --> 01:54:11,269
I got in the same old routine and...

1872
01:54:11,353 --> 01:54:13,311
...before I knew it I was on it again.

1873
01:54:14,186 --> 01:54:15,894
But you can't leave me!

1874
01:54:16,353 --> 01:54:18,311
You... you gotta stay and
take care of me.

1875
01:54:19,644 --> 01:54:22,186
I know I'm responsible for
how y'are, Zosch.

1876
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:24,478
But I can't go around
the rest of my life...

1877
01:54:24,478 --> 01:54:26,186
...stoning myself to death about it.

1878
01:54:27,311 --> 01:54:29,311
I've been carrying my heart
ever since it happened.

1879
01:54:30,936 --> 01:54:32,769
Even now it hurts me to
think about it.

1880
01:54:32,894 --> 01:54:33,519
But...

1881
01:54:35,686 --> 01:54:38,769
...well - it's not I wanna leave.

1882
01:54:39,644 --> 01:54:40,644
I gotta leave.

1883
01:54:41,728 --> 01:54:45,394
You mustn't leave. Frankie!
You mustn't leave!

1884
01:54:46,478 --> 01:54:47,436
Zosch...

1885
01:54:49,644 --> 01:54:51,186
...say good-bye to me, Zosch.

1886
01:54:52,353 --> 01:54:56,686
You think you're foolin' me? I know what's
pullin' ya away - Molly!

1887
01:54:57,644 --> 01:54:57,978
No.

1888
01:54:58,019 --> 01:55:00,936
You're only goin' just so you can
be with that little tramp!

1889
01:55:03,519 --> 01:55:05,394
- Frankie, no!
- Goodbye, Zosch.

1890
01:55:05,561 --> 01:55:11,144
No, Frankie! Please don't leave.
Frankie - no. No, don't leave me!

1891
01:55:34,728 --> 01:55:35,936
Get dressed, Zosch.

1892
01:56:12,811 --> 01:56:13,311
Zosch!

1893
01:56:18,769 --> 01:56:19,186
Zosch!

1894
01:56:24,103 --> 01:56:24,853
Zosch!!!

1895
01:56:41,769 --> 01:56:42,228
Zosch?

1896
01:56:48,019 --> 01:56:50,728
Zosch, don't move.

1897
01:56:51,894 --> 01:56:53,728
Don't try to talk - you're
gonna' be all right.

1898
01:57:01,811 --> 01:57:06,269
I love you so much. So---

1899
01:57:07,769 --> 01:57:08,853
Zosch.
