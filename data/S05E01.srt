ï»¿1
00:00:00,073 --> 00:00:02,679
Mr Shelby, you're not yourself.
I should call a doctor.

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:06,186
It's just myself talking to myself
about myself.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,019
Michael, you're going to New York.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,139
Why?

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,019
Because the company has business
to attend to in America.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,340
You knew I was going to be shot...

7
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,700
...and you chose not to tell me.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,599
I chose my mum.

9
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:28,699
Thomas Shelby, Labour Party, 48,564!

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,139
I've been to a doctor on your behalf.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,620
It starts when you stop. When you rest.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,980
Mr Shelby, you're meant to be resting.

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,460
I have learnt something, Frances.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,219
There's no rest for me in this world.

15
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,500
Perhaps in the next.

16
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:17,095
_

17
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,259
Arthur?

18
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,780
"We cannot give you the assurance
you are asking for.

19
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,660
"We expect payment in full."

20
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,166
Here's my favourite part.

21
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,959
"We have never even heard of your people,

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,359
"so we are not afraid of your threats."

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,160
And they've signed it
"the Angels of Retribution".

24
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
Hmm.

25
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:30,399
They say they haven't even heard of us.

26
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,039
So tell Aberama and Isiah to
introduce themselves.

27
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,519
And, Finn...

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,220
...you stay out of it.

29
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah?

30
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,999
Wait.

31
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Wait, wait. Say that again.

32
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,799
No.

33
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,480
No, that cannot be possible!

34
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:55,940
Peter, my beautiful pilot...

35
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,900
Now, will you please fly me
and my winnings back to England?

36
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,120
Ten spoonfuls of sugar for me, please.

37
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,999
Where's that full one?

38
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,500
Look, Ruby.

39
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,320
Daddy's back from his call.

40
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,200
Everything's going to be all right now.

41
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,879
Oh, no, no.

42
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,440
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,279
Oh, no, no.

44
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,480
Ah!

45
00:07:58,927 --> 00:07:59,799
- Hello?

46
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Arthur! Arthur, where's Tommy?

47
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,518
Just get to him and tell him
that we've lost the lot!

48
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,582
Stay there. You stay put.

49
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:14,069
You'll hear from Tommy.

50
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:18,479
Arthur, what are you talking about?
How is that possible?

51
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,479
It's possible because, this morning

52
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,959
in New York City at 6am,

53
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,394
the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed

54
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,314
like a steam train.

55
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,754
We were most definitely on board.

56
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,554
Fuck it.

57
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:56,154
- Oi! Come on, get changed!
- Jesus Christ!

58
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,754
Bring the car round!

59
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:08,234
We've got to get out of here.
Hurry up! Come on!

60
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:09,900
I'm going!

61
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:13,400
Change of plan.
We're not going to London any more.

62
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:16,504
- We're going straight to Birmingham.
- There are other passengers.

63
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,634
Not any more.

64
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,634
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

65
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:50,051
- No. No.
- I love you, you love me.

66
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:52,354
- That's the truth.
- Gina, wait, come on.

67
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:55,115
- I want to meet your family.
- No, you don't.

68
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,635
Argh!

69
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:41,075
Now you've heard of us.

71
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:52,514
Come on.

72
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:54,234
Couch. Couch!

73
00:10:54,235 --> 00:10:57,794
Put something down for the blood.
My sister'll fucking kill me.

74
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:59,514
Be fucking careful!

75
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,794
She spends thousands of pounds
on this shit.

76
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,314
Argh!

77
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:05,835
- Get me some booze.
- Ah!

78
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:14,220
Just fucking get the thing out of me
and sew me up. Just do it.

79
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:19,235
Peaky boy, give me your blade.

80
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,554
That's enough.

81
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,034
Don't want you throwing up
on your sister's furniture.

82
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,954
- You know what you're doing?
- I've done this a thousand times.

83
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:38,034
I once took a bullet from between
two ribs, one inch from the heart.

84
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,594
Mind you, it was a horse.

85
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,474
And the horse did die.

86
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,075
Hold him. Hold him.

87
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,394
There you go. Just a little one.

88
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:03,554
- What the fuck is going on?!
- Oh, fuck.

89
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,394
Hello, Ada.

90
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,795
Get out, both of you.

91
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:16,954
Push this on the wound.

92
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,635
- Keep up the pressure.
- Get out.

93
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,794
I'm so sorry, Ada. They broke a
statue of some thin woman.

94
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,994
Fucking statues.

95
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,834
What has Tommy told you?

96
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,514
- Shelbys stay out of the sporting stuff.
- What?

97
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,147
- To maintain his fucking reputation?
- Oi!

98
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:36,674
You listen to me. We've got a chance.

99
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,234
Tommy has given us that chance.

100
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:43,394
He's got power, we've got money,
and our past is left behind us.

101
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,754
And you've got a precious young
life, Finn, you fucking idiot.

102
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:49,074
Three inches to the left
and that would have been gone.

103
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:55,514
You've got nothing to prove, Finn.

104
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:58,355
You have got nothing to prove.

105
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,951
Daddy! Daddy!

106
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:09,234
Come here, you. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

107
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,834
Come here. Come here. Ooh!

108
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,554
Now, what have you been up to, eh?

109
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,075
Get it done, Johnny.

110
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,755
All right, you heard the man. Let's go.

111
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,674
Where's Charles?

112
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:34,274
He's in the wagon. He won't come out.

113
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:36,314
He heard Johnny talking Rokker.

114
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,794
He understands more Gypsy than we think.

115
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:41,754
He heard him say you shot the horse.
I told him it was mercy.

116
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:45,435
I said it's what you do when a horse
gets sick. He doesn't understand.

117
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,894
Dad, why did you shoot him?

118
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:57,034
Charlie, get out here now.
Let's get it done.

119
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,355
Charles? Come here.

120
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:05,835
Sit down.

121
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,007
Now, listen to me.

122
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,434
Your horse was sick. He was in pain.

123
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,274
The vet couldn't do anything,
even Curly couldn't do anything.

124
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,515
I put him to sleep.

125
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,794
- It's what you do.
- No! It's what YOU do!

126
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:29,475
Shoot horses, shoot people!
Everybody says!

127
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,635
Dangerous, my beautiful horse.

128
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,060
Too wild to race.

129
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:17,115
Wouldn't take the reins or the whip.

130
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:20,981
Should have been a war horse.

131
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,281
Got tired of the pasture.

132
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,447
Couldn't stick the peace and quiet,
gave up on life...

133
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,660
...and is now free.

134
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:38,761
In the bleak...

135
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,501
You're crying.

136
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:18,820
Tom...

137
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,794
...I'm sorry.

138
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,834
I didn't know your boy spoke Rokker.

139
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,435
Fill it in, Johnny.

140
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,660
It's fine.

141
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:35,714
I've called the house, the office.

142
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,008
But if I tell you...

143
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,435
...you won't believe it...

144
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,514
...so I'll show you.

145
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,115
Huh?

146
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,914
I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.

147
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,220
Yeah.

148
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:08,914
Fucking Michael... said he was
advised by the broker that prices

149
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,434
would rebound.

150
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:13,100
Everybody was told the same thing.

151
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,587
He held on.

152
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,115
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,501
Michael.

154
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,475
- Michael held on?
- Yeah.

155
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,875
Michael held on...

156
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:55,780
...and carried on dancing and playing...

157
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,355
...and fucking in the snow.

158
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,235
Charlie!

159
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:04,515
Charlie, come out here now!

160
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:07,754
Kid never fucking listens.

161
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,875
Never listens, Lizzie!

162
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:15,674
What do I have to do to make people

163
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,834
fucking listen to me?!

164
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,074
Holy fuck!

165
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,875
What do we do now, Tommy, eh?

166
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,908
What do we do?

167
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,408
Lizzie, you go with Arthur to Birmingham,

168
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,059
you stay in the Midland Hotel.
Arthur, call a full meeting

169
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,434
of the board of directors
tomorrow at noon.

170
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:42,957
A full fucking meeting.

171
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:46,074
What about today, eh?
What's wrong with today, Tom?

172
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,274
- I need to do some thinking.
- Oh, yeah.

173
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:50,834
Oh, you do that best on your own,
don't you, eh?

174
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:53,154
I won't be on my own. Never on my own.

175
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,300
Lizzie, you have the driver
come back tomorrow.

176
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,220
And, Arthur, tell my boy...

177
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:04,114
...that sometimes death is a kindness.

178
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,040
Come on.

179
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,195
What now?

180
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,274
What am I, a genie?

181
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:03,715
You summon me up
with your little bottle of dope?

182
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:09,635
I take it for the pain, to keep warm.

183
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,161
Is that what it's for?

184
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:21,688
The warmth?

185
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:26,355
The warmth.

186
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:31,355
All this time...

187
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,181
I know.

188
00:20:36,675 --> 00:20:38,820
Our love still remains.

189
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:45,380
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

190
00:20:48,195 --> 00:20:50,300
Do what they tell you to do.

191
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,340
Too much to do, Grace.

192
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:58,381
The kids...

193
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:04,754
I need to say goodbye.

194
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,195
I need to sleep.

195
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,595
Just think, Tom.

196
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:24,813
Linda!

197
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:34,754
Oh, there you are, eh?

198
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,474
You're the chairman, Arthur,
so start acting like one.

199
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:43,481
Chairman, am I, hmm?

200
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,140
No.

201
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:52,300
I'm the fucking doorman, Linda, hmm?

202
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:56,260
And you ain't coming in here
tonight, love, dressed like that.

203
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,914
Tommy made me chairman so that...

204
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,195
...he could stay clean.

205
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,500
It's called an arrangement.

206
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,875
It's an opportunity.

207
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:27,140
I know who I am, Linda.

208
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:32,420
I know who I am
and I'm all right with it.

209
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:34,968
Finally.

210
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,008
I can live with it.

211
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,515
I need you to be all right with it.

212
00:22:57,595 --> 00:23:01,954
I need you to be all right with it, eh?

213
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,875
What is it, eh?

214
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:06,755
And what do you want, hmm?

215
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:10,980
What, do you want the chairman?
Do you? Hmm?

216
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:17,060
With his fancy briefcase
and his gold fountain pen, eh?

217
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,841
What do you want?

218
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,221
Chairman...

219
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:26,474
...or doorman? Hmm?

220
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:31,180
You think we can fuck and it'll be
OK and I'll be quiet. Well, I won't.

221
00:23:32,515 --> 00:23:34,152
Every week,
your brother's down in London,

222
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:35,994
making out he's fucking Robin Hood,

223
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:39,234
champion of the people, while you're
up here running the racket for him.

224
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,994
And according to your "arrangement",
if anything should happen,

225
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:45,075
it'd be you who takes the blame,
does the time or swings for it.

226
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:53,180
- And what do you want?
- I want you...

227
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,371
...to take the opportunity

228
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:59,811
that God and the New York Stock
Exchange has presented to you.

229
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,594
Mr Shelby,
the meeting will be starting soon.

230
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,780
Yeah. All right.

231
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:09,515
Be right there.

232
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,414
Thank you, Edna.

233
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,675
And shut the door.

234
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:54,660
OK, now...

235
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,155
Mmm, they're nice.

236
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:59,315
...let's begin.

237
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:04,700
Yesterday, as you all know,
there was a fucking terrible...

238
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:10,114
There was a terrible disaster. Hmm?

239
00:25:10,115 --> 00:25:11,475
It wasn't just for us.

240
00:25:12,935 --> 00:25:14,295
It was for the whole world.

241
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:18,675
Happened in New York.

242
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:21,234
That's where it happened.

243
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,835
And it slowly spread to London.

244
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:27,780
And then to, er, fucking Hong Kong. Hmm?

245
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,555
Whole thing... whole thing went up.

246
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:37,420
Well, actually the whole thing
went fucking down, but...

247
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:44,700
...we wasn't the only ones hurt by this.

248
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,321
Whole world is hurt.

249
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:50,575
A lot of people.

250
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:53,314
In the papers.

251
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:55,034
It's all over the news.

252
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,995
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Arthur?

253
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:00,114
Shouldn't we just wait for Thomas?

254
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:03,740
Polly, Arthur's now
the chairman of the board.

255
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,674
Er, Mr Chairman,
perhaps while we wait for Thomas,

256
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:10,354
I might lighten the gloom and

257
00:26:10,355 --> 00:26:14,074
express, as a relatively new member
of this company, what a pleasure

258
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:16,714
it is to be in a boardroom that
has so many females in it,

259
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:21,994
and all females who are both
sharp-witted and decorative.

260
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:25,474
Yeah, well, we're a very
modern company, Mr Greene.

261
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,923
Indeed.

262
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:29,874
Although there are still some
among us who cling to their

263
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,034
old-fashioned values.

264
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:36,675
How far have we got?

265
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:40,034
We've established
that ladies are decorative.

266
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:42,074
We've only just sat down, Tom.

267
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:45,754
Actually, um, Arthur has some
documents that he'd like to hand out.

268
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:48,700
Yeah? What documents?

269
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:54,474
I was just explaining to everyone,
Tom, that, um, well, we're fucked.

270
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:57,824
- Ain't that right? Hmm?
- Yes and no.

271
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:02,754
It is true that a large proportion
of the company's funds

272
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,994
were invested in American stocks
and shares.

273
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:07,915
Invested or hidden?

274
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:11,434
All investments are approved
by the board, Linda.

275
00:27:11,435 --> 00:27:14,435
Only the ones that went
through the books, Thomas.

276
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,500
Linda, after this meeting there will
be another meeting, for just family.

277
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:22,515
Did we vote on this?

278
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:29,875
- Arthur?
- "Arthur, can't you control your wife?"

279
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:33,355
We are a very modern company, Mr Greene.

280
00:27:36,774 --> 00:27:40,453
To be precise, everything we channelled

281
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:43,954
through the New York Stock Exchange
is now offering a return

282
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:46,195
of ten cents to the dollar.

283
00:27:47,355 --> 00:27:48,714
And the Nolan Bank of America,

284
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:51,314
where we invested our fluidity,

285
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:55,234
is offering five cents to the dollar
on all deposits.

286
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,805
Yeah.

287
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,954
- There is hope.
- Why?

288
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:02,435
What have you got in there, a magic wand?

289
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,154
As nonexecutive director of the
company, I need the permission from

290
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,874
the chairman
to present my strategy to the board.

291
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:15,314
Permission granted, Tom.

292
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:05,234
The Peaky Blinders are coming!
The Peaky Blinders are coming!

293
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:07,595
Micky, the Peaky Blinders are coming!

294
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:12,346
Ladies and gents,
Peaky Blinders are on their way.

295
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:14,100
Please vacate. Thank you.

296
00:29:26,955 --> 00:29:29,154
- Good to see you.
- All right, Mr Shelby.

297
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,714
- Mr Shelby...
- Yeah?

298
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:33,474
- ...thank you for what you did.
- What did I do?

299
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:35,994
He was going to evict us,
that bastard Fellows.

300
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:38,474
Now he's cut our rent in half.

301
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,755
Good. Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it.

302
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:43,514
All right?

303
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,234
How far can we go, Mr Shelby,
with this beautiful dream?

304
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:49,394
- All the way, brother. All the way.
- Revolution, man!

305
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:53,434
This crash, Mr Shelby. They're
saying they're gonna cut my hours.

306
00:29:53,435 --> 00:29:55,874
- Yeah. Where do you work?
- Greenhams Engineering.

307
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:58,834
Greenham brothers. I know them.
They're not gonna cut your hours.

308
00:29:58,835 --> 00:30:00,714
God bless you. God bless you both.

309
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,274
- Enjoy your drink.
- Gentlemen and ladies.

310
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,474
If you'll all move into the saloon bar,

311
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:07,914
where you will all be served
a free pint of stingo.

312
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:13,074
Any man who served in France
gets a brandy chaser.

313
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,554
And in spite of what you're reading
in the newspapers,

314
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,754
I want to hear singing and laughing.
Fuck the stock market.

315
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,034
Fuck the stock market!

316
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:23,395
They backed the wrong horses,
so fucking what, eh?

317
00:30:24,515 --> 00:30:27,954
Thank you, Mr Shelby. At last,
a politician who gets things done.

318
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,754
You're welcome, brother, you're welcome.

319
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:31,434
- Get down off the furniture.
- Sorry, Ada.

320
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:33,115
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

321
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,475
Right.

322
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:42,474
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

323
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:44,594
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

324
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,514
Your husband believes that being seen

325
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:48,914
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

326
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:52,074
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism, perhaps next time,

327
00:30:52,075 --> 00:30:54,674
Polly, you won't wear earrings worth
more than the pub.

328
00:30:54,675 --> 00:30:57,634
Right. Family meeting. First item.

329
00:30:58,334 --> 00:30:59,974
This.

330
00:31:00,355 --> 00:31:02,554
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

331
00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:05,074
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

332
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,754
Finn?

333
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:09,626
He says they were sent to Limehouse.
Chinatown.

334
00:31:09,627 --> 00:31:11,074
Sent by fucking who?

335
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:12,474
Sent by me.

336
00:31:12,475 --> 00:31:15,955
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

337
00:31:17,115 --> 00:31:20,194
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

338
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:21,629
I listen to you when you tell me

339
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,234
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

340
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:27,500
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

341
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,155
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

342
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,394
Â£50,000.

343
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,834
In cash.

344
00:31:36,835 --> 00:31:39,915
He said they were sent to
Chinatown to kill somebody.

345
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:43,394
That kid needs educating,
Tommy, really does.

346
00:31:43,395 --> 00:31:44,954
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

347
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:48,213
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

348
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:50,714
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

349
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,874
But you told Polly.

350
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,972
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

351
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:59,754
Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hmm?

352
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,274
This pimp was blackmailing a senior
member of the House of Lords,

353
00:32:03,275 --> 00:32:07,274
- a very wealthy man.
- Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

354
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:10,302
covered in flies. World's a better place.

355
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:15,155
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

356
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,715
Sometimes, Ada...

357
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,994
...killing is a kindness.

358
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:23,355
Hmm?

359
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,954
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

360
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,754
We received intelligence from

361
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:32,947
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

362
00:32:32,948 --> 00:32:36,794
I've made lots of new friends in
London. Men with influence.

363
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,194
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

364
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:43,074
He wasn't worth a trial. The coppers
cleared the streets for us.

365
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:46,714
This was work commissioned by a High
Court judge, by Scotland Yard

366
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,274
and by the House of Lords.

367
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,149
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

368
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,394
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

369
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:55,274
Lizzie, you need to understand.

370
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:58,874
- That you tell Polly, not me.
- You need to understand

371
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:02,034
that the corridors of Westminster
are very dimly lit.

372
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:05,474
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

373
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,393
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

374
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:11,806
- "We"? WE own the ropes, do we?
- Lizzie, Lizzie,

375
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:13,954
if Finn had've listened to me,
you wouldn't have known.

376
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:16,035
When we go home, I'll explain.

377
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,395
I can't be bothered with this shit.

378
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:25,834
So...

379
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:29,955
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

380
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:33,074
The strategy I outlined earlier

381
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:36,714
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

382
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,434
In the meantime...
Just business as fucking usual.

383
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,467
In the meantime, it is fortunate
that we have maintained

384
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,226
other sources of cash income.

385
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:48,234
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

386
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,594
And cash we have.

387
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,434
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

388
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,195
You're gonna hang yourself.

389
00:33:54,995 --> 00:33:58,043
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

390
00:33:58,044 --> 00:33:59,915
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

391
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,820
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

392
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,540
Polly...

393
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:10,115
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

394
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:18,394
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

395
00:34:18,395 --> 00:34:19,653
She's pregnant.

396
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:24,293
Ada's what?!

397
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:27,877
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

398
00:34:27,995 --> 00:34:30,555
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

399
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:34,594
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hmm?

400
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:39,114
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

401
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,088
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives
a fuck who the father is.

402
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:44,361
Really?

403
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:47,315
I already know who the father is.

404
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:50,995
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

405
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,995
OK.

406
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,340
All right, go on, then.

407
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,554
How long you known about Ada, huh?

408
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:15,915
I know her doctor. He calls me.

409
00:35:18,604 --> 00:35:20,794
Yeah, longer than me.

410
00:35:20,795 --> 00:35:22,675
Have a look at this.

411
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,594
What's that funny writing on there?

412
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:33,154
Chinese.

413
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:35,020
Ah, right.

414
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:38,515
What is it? Hmm?

415
00:35:39,854 --> 00:35:41,294
Bad news?

416
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,314
Maybe.

417
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,394
- Angels of Retribution?
- Yeah.

418
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,874
Burn the letter they sent.

419
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,675
It's already done.

420
00:35:57,795 --> 00:35:59,355
Look at that, Tom. Hmm?

421
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,260
Pulled from our brother, eh?

422
00:36:04,635 --> 00:36:06,700
Finally took a first bullet.

423
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:09,601
No-one fucking listens to me.

424
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,074
Here, give it here. I'll keep it for him.

425
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,875
I still have my first one.

426
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:31,700
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

427
00:36:32,995 --> 00:36:35,034
Where are you going, brother?

428
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:12,274
The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

429
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:16,234
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

430
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:21,474
I therefore must ask the trade
unions to possess understanding.

431
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:25,354
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

432
00:37:25,355 --> 00:37:29,514
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

433
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:34,835
Mr Thomas Shelby.

434
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,715
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

435
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:43,434
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

436
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:46,634
asks that following the crash,

437
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:51,180
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

438
00:37:52,715 --> 00:37:56,420
What he's really asking is that the
working man carry the can.

439
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:02,234
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

440
00:38:02,235 --> 00:38:05,302
when compared to the wild games of chance

441
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:07,394
being played in London and New York

442
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:10,143
by gamblers in silk gloves

443
00:38:10,144 --> 00:38:12,674
and beaver hats, who,
when they lose their bets,

444
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:15,034
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

445
00:38:16,329 --> 00:38:20,274
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

446
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:23,834
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

447
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,289
that those who so recklessly
lost their fortunes

448
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,074
on the capitalist lottery

449
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,554
learn to shine their own shoes...

450
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:34,754
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

451
00:38:42,608 --> 00:38:44,088
Mr Shelby?

452
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:48,034
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

453
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:49,634
You speak very eloquently.

454
00:38:49,635 --> 00:38:51,020
Thank you.

455
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,514
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

456
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,314
Yeah, I know who you are.

457
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:59,554
My constituency borders yours.

458
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:03,100
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

459
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,620
Come.

460
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:13,555
Ah.

461
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:17,475
I have bad news, Mr...

462
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,555
Shelby.

463
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:27,354
We agreed 50,000
on completion of business.

464
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:31,474
My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

465
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,674
There's 20 there.

466
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,555
You'll have to wait for the rest.

467
00:39:48,195 --> 00:39:51,434
- Cavalry, eh?
- Mm.

468
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:52,595
Huh!

469
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:54,955
Yeah.

470
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,780
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

471
00:40:00,755 --> 00:40:05,860
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

472
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,434
When the cavalry finally came,

473
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:12,114
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

474
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:16,915
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

475
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:21,994
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

476
00:40:21,995 --> 00:40:25,674
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

477
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:27,435
All for a game of chance.

478
00:40:30,075 --> 00:40:33,634
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

479
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:37,434
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

480
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,634
that will cause you concern.

481
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:41,914
I now have them in a safe place.

482
00:40:41,915 --> 00:40:48,220
On Monday you will give me
the full Â£50,000 in cash...

483
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:51,515
...or I will steal your
white horse from under you.

484
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:57,514
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

485
00:40:57,515 --> 00:41:00,194
in a place of power and privilege?!

486
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:02,514
A man like me?

487
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:07,674
A man like me?

488
00:41:08,915 --> 00:41:10,794
Lord Suckerby...

489
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:12,715
...I've seen the photographs.

490
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,300
Monday.

491
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:24,315
Shelby!

492
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:27,354
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

493
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:29,700
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

494
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,554
The police are concerned about the
effect of the crash in industrial areas.

495
00:41:33,555 --> 00:41:35,914
- Right.
- Everything all right?

496
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:37,554
Yeah, fine.

497
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:40,100
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

498
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:42,460
Your brother been busy?

499
00:41:42,955 --> 00:41:46,554
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

500
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,674
the former Communist MP for Battersea.

501
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:51,394
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall,

502
00:41:51,395 --> 00:41:52,973
he's setting up a meeting,

503
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:55,067
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers,

504
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:58,748
Nottingham and Derby,
organised by two Communist convenors

505
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,474
not formerly known to Special Branch.

506
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:04,514
He's also had a telephone
conversation with Jessie Eden,

507
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:08,154
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

508
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:11,914
But he'll report more when he sees
her. It's all in there, though.

509
00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:13,474
Names and everything.

510
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:16,216
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

511
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:19,914
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

512
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:23,274
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

513
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,315
Times are hard.

514
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,180
Hmm.

515
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,955
Exactly how much did you lose?

516
00:42:34,115 --> 00:42:36,674
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

517
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:38,441
He thinks that we can turn the collapse

518
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:40,834
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

519
00:42:40,835 --> 00:42:44,394
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

520
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,755
He says, "We can wave cash in the
faces of desperate men."

521
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:52,354
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

522
00:42:53,342 --> 00:42:56,754
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

523
00:42:56,755 --> 00:42:59,795
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

524
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:18,115
Fuck.

525
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:25,391
Come.

526
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:28,034
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

527
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,715
It's from Winston Churchill.

528
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:34,474
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin,

529
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:36,794
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

530
00:43:36,795 --> 00:43:39,754
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

531
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:42,594
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

532
00:43:42,595 --> 00:43:47,195
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost Â£75,000 in two hours.

533
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:50,820
And you?

534
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,940
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

535
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,514
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

536
00:43:57,515 --> 00:43:58,643
You lock up.

537
00:43:58,644 --> 00:44:02,060
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

538
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,154
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

539
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,034
A journalist from the Times.

540
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:08,634
He used to be with the Birmingham Mail.

541
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:10,514
He sent you some questions.

542
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,474
You said you wanted to meet him.

543
00:44:12,475 --> 00:44:13,900
He's outside.

544
00:44:14,555 --> 00:44:15,900
Yes.

545
00:44:16,675 --> 00:44:18,195
Send him in.

546
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,075
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London Times.

547
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:28,194
Have a seat.

548
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:30,235
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

549
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:39,620
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

550
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:42,740
No.

551
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:48,074
Once, in Small Heath, you were
burning photographs of the King.

552
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:54,314
- London Times. You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

553
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,714
I sent you a list of questions.

554
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,675
Yeah, I misplaced them.

555
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,987
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

556
00:45:02,012 --> 00:45:03,194
Yes.

557
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:06,114
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

558
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:07,340
Oh!

559
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:09,315
Good.

560
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,354
Sorry, just...

561
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,348
Ah, here we are.

562
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:17,341
Yes, um...

563
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:23,573
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

564
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:26,026
print journalists take
no interest in the, er,

565
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:28,661
the private lives of politicians.

566
00:45:28,686 --> 00:45:30,420
Private lives?

567
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:34,540
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

568
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:39,300
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

569
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:42,754
Readers are beginning to say...

570
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:46,114
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

571
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:47,514
Of course.

572
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,475
In these modern times.

573
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,846
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

574
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:57,790
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

575
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:00,834
- or business affairs...
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

576
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:02,795
I'm no gentleman.

577
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,821
Hmm.

578
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,794
Er, Mr Shelby, as I said in my letter,

579
00:46:10,795 --> 00:46:14,060
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.

580
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:17,994
And of course, working in that city,

581
00:46:17,995 --> 00:46:20,620
it was impossible
not to know your name...

582
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:25,380
...and your reputation.

583
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:30,754
So, when I saw that you
had been elected as a socialist...

584
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:32,674
You reflected on the fact

585
00:46:32,675 --> 00:46:38,100
that working people can indeed
change their lives for the better...

586
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:43,447
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

587
00:46:43,448 --> 00:46:46,274
aim for happier outcomes,

588
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:49,114
even win awards for industry.

589
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:50,994
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

590
00:46:50,995 --> 00:46:54,435
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

591
00:46:55,955 --> 00:47:00,954
Was your conversion from
bookmaker to socialist politician

592
00:47:00,955 --> 00:47:04,300
a gradual thing or...

593
00:47:05,195 --> 00:47:08,300
...a road to Damascus experience?

594
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:11,300
Yeah.

595
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,835
Now I hear that question...

596
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,314
...I remember receiving your letters

597
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:20,355
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

598
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:24,954
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

599
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:29,194
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

600
00:47:29,195 --> 00:47:32,051
But, since 1923, I've made my fortune

601
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:34,274
in the manufacture, sale and
export of motor cars.

602
00:47:34,275 --> 00:47:35,834
And lately gin.

603
00:47:35,835 --> 00:47:38,595
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

604
00:47:42,115 --> 00:47:44,580
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

605
00:47:45,315 --> 00:47:47,660
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

606
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:52,060
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

607
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,955
there was a Major Campbell.

608
00:47:55,995 --> 00:47:57,475
He was found dead.

609
00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:01,140
A member of your family was charged.

610
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:12,860
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

611
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:18,220
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

612
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,914
Is it evolution or revolution?

613
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:25,074
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

614
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:28,794
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

615
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:33,674
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

616
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,706
I am talking about specific events, sir.

617
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:37,099
Which I don't recall...

618
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:41,006
...with which I was never
personally linked,

619
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:44,275
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

620
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:53,754
Yeah, now...

621
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:56,275
...I recall receiving your letter...

622
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:59,861
...and I recall that when I did...

623
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:05,035
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

624
00:49:08,327 --> 00:49:09,887
Just a moment.

625
00:49:14,835 --> 00:49:17,880
Here we are.

626
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:28,794
Ah, Michael Levitt.

627
00:49:28,795 --> 00:49:30,140
Correct?

628
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,274
- Yes.
- Yes.

629
00:49:33,275 --> 00:49:35,074
Journalist.

630
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,954
Unmarried.

631
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:38,835
An apartment in Maida Vale.

632
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:43,700
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

633
00:49:45,355 --> 00:49:48,100
"Unmarried" is underlined.

634
00:49:48,515 --> 00:49:51,674
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

635
00:49:51,675 --> 00:49:53,474
Sometimes alone.

636
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,521
Sometimes not alone.

637
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:59,087
Sometimes with other men.

638
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:09,035
Sometimes with other men.

639
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:15,515
I'm old-fashioned... Michael.

640
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:19,155
I believe private lives
should remain private.

641
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,835
Not everything modern is good,
now, is it?

642
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,080
You gonna write this down...

643
00:50:30,035 --> 00:50:32,035
...in your little fucking book?

644
00:50:40,035 --> 00:50:41,714
Well?

645
00:50:41,715 --> 00:50:43,634
Not yet.

646
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:45,434
I didn't tell him.

647
00:50:45,435 --> 00:50:48,755
Him knowing or not knowing has no
relevance to what we're drinking.

648
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:51,468
It's vintage.

649
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,500
Fuck it.

650
00:50:56,234 --> 00:50:57,594
This...

651
00:50:59,075 --> 00:51:00,955
...is for us.

652
00:51:02,595 --> 00:51:04,235
Let's drink to the baby.

653
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:09,035
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

654
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:13,594
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

655
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:15,460
I was going to get rid of it.

656
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,101
What about this time?

657
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,881
Imagine.

658
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:27,034
The father's scared.

659
00:51:27,035 --> 00:51:28,834
He runs away.

660
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,355
You're left.

661
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:34,394
Oh, sweetheart.

662
00:51:34,395 --> 00:51:36,634
The baby's black,

663
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,940
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

664
00:51:41,235 --> 00:51:42,820
But you don't care.

665
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:46,300
Because the world has changed.

666
00:51:47,515 --> 00:51:49,954
And the baby's eyes are golden.

667
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,825
And you're gonna leave her

668
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:54,754
with Aunt Polly every day to look after.

669
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:58,114
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

670
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,314
How do you know it's a her?

671
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,740
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

672
00:52:03,475 --> 00:52:05,354
It's a girl?

673
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,768
Golden.

674
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:10,954
To be born in the year 1930,

675
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:13,715
where everything will be changed
for the better.

676
00:52:15,435 --> 00:52:18,355
She'll be the colour
of a Hollywood Oscar.

677
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,207
What will Tommy say?

678
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,061
Tommy knows.

679
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,780
Hmm!

680
00:52:32,907 --> 00:52:34,624
He's also seen that the world's

681
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:37,540
big and round and he says, "So what?"

682
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,555
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

683
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,395
We are flying above the rules now.

684
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:54,100
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

685
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:56,715
That's the beauty.

686
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:12,275
Hello, Cyril.

687
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:16,107
Least you're still talking to me.

688
00:53:25,715 --> 00:53:26,994
Where is everyone?

689
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,875
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

690
00:53:32,315 --> 00:53:34,620
You know, Frances,

691
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:39,000
if there were to be a snap election
in this house today...

692
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:41,741
...wouldn't win it...

693
00:53:42,555 --> 00:53:45,514
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

694
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:48,795
- No. I gathered.
- Mm.

695
00:53:50,475 --> 00:53:52,194
Where's Charles?

696
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,660
Charles is in the stable.

697
00:53:55,555 --> 00:53:56,940
Thank you.

698
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,354
Did Arthur explain?

699
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,235
He said it's God's will.

700
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:23,900
But you're not God!

701
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:36,860
No, I'm not God.

702
00:54:41,435 --> 00:54:43,035
Not yet.
