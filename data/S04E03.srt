﻿1
00:00:04,000 -- 00:00:06,880
I want you to be alive after your
entire family is dead

2
00:00:06,880 -- 00:00:08,960
that is what will hurt you the most.

3
00:00:08,960 -- 00:00:10,520
Michael is badly wounded.

4
00:00:10,520 -- 00:00:11,880
John is dead.

5
00:00:11,880 -- 00:00:14,960
So I sent a message to Aberama Gold.

6
00:00:14,960 -- 00:00:16,800
I need you back. I'll help you

7
00:00:16,800 -- 00:00:19,720
cos Michael wants me to help
you. Starting now.

8
00:00:19,720 -- 00:00:21,440
The bullet's been written.

9
00:00:21,440 -- 00:00:24,400
He, as the oldest brother...
I'll put this bullet into his head.

10
00:00:24,400 -- 00:00:27,800
You said you'd bring every man
and woman out on strike.

11
00:00:27,800 -- 00:00:29,120
Do you have a whistle?

12
00:00:29,120 -- 00:00:31,600
It's almost as if you want trouble.

13
00:01:05,560 -- 00:01:10,880
All right. First come, first served,
form an orderly line, all of you.

14
00:01:10,880 -- 00:01:13,400
All right. All right.

15
00:01:15,640 -- 00:01:19,920
Right! Have your contracts of
employment in your hand!

16
00:01:19,920 -- 00:01:22,720
Bring 'em in! Get in there.

17
00:01:22,720 -- 00:01:26,800
Get moving! On you go!
Go on, keep going!

18
00:01:26,800 -- 00:01:30,120
Keep going. Whoa, where
are you going? Bradley. Foreman

19
00:01:30,120 -- 00:01:33,520
All right. You go
and see that man over there. Go!

20
00:01:35,680 -- 00:01:38,280
What's your name?
Bradley. I'm a foreman.

21
00:01:38,280 -- 00:01:39,920
When did you last work here? 1922.

22
00:01:39,920 -- 00:01:41,760
How many have done this
type of work before?

23
00:01:41,760 -- 00:01:44,600
They're mostly farm hands from down
Worcester way. But I'll show 'em.

24
00:01:44,600 -- 00:01:46,800
Hungry men learn fast.
All right. On you go.

25
00:01:46,800 -- 00:01:50,320
Dirty scabs! Blacklegs!

26
00:01:52,360 -- 00:01:56,200
What bastard threw that?
Get him out here!

27
00:02:05,520 -- 00:02:09,400
Arthur! Oi! Enough. Get him out!

28
00:02:09,400 -- 00:02:11,240
Get out!

29
00:02:11,240 -- 00:02:12,800
Ten more!

30
00:02:16,160 -- 00:02:20,840
Two more. Ten. That's it.
Clo

31
00:02:25,920 -- 00:02:30,040
Right. Ten bob a man.
£2 there for you.

32
00:02:30,040 -- 00:02:32,640
What about security?
Yeah, well, about that...

33
00:02:32,640 -- 00:02:35,560
By order of the city of Birmingham
police department,

34
00:02:35,560 -- 00:02:39,400
you and your ugly workforce
are now under the protection...

35
00:02:40,640 -- 00:02:43,120
..of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

36
00:02:59,080 -- 00:03:01,520
Mr Gray? Yeah, send him in.

37
00:03:01,520 -- 00:03:02,920
It's your mother.

38
00:03:02,920 -- 00:03:04,760
Oh, fuck.

39
00:03:16,360 -- 00:03:18,400
I read about it in the paper.

40
00:03:21,000 -- 00:03:22,440
I have a right.

41
00:03:25,120 -- 00:03:26,920
I'm your mum, as well.

42
00:03:32,160 -- 00:03:33,840
You want me to go away?

43
00:03:36,080 -- 00:03:37,440
Yes.

44
00:03:40,640 -- 00:03:42,240
I'll just leave these.

45
00:03:47,520 -- 00:03:49,160
They're from our orchard.

46
00:03:55,800 -- 00:03:57,560
You used to love these.

47
00:03:59,200 -- 00:04:00,960
I hope there are no worms in them.

48
00:04:26,200 -- 00:04:31,120
Look, I just wanted to say that
you're welcome to come home.

49
00:04:32,720 -- 00:04:34,520
To get better at home.

50
00:04:34,520 -- 00:04:36,680
I know you got
bored in the village, but...

51
00:04:39,240 -- 00:04:40,880
..we love you -

52
00:04:40,880 -- 00:04:44,480
and your little brother misses
playing football with you...

53
00:04:46,000 -- 00:04:47,480
..and your dad...

54
00:04:50,160 -- 00:04:51,200
..passed on.

55
00:04:53,280 -- 00:04:56,000
He passed on
peacefully in our bed.

56
00:04:59,160 -- 00:05:00,440
Fuck.

57
00:05:06,240 -- 00:05:08,160
Now go on.

58
00:05:08,160 -- 00:05:12,240
I'm expecting Tommy,
and he's due here now.

59
00:05:14,280 -- 00:05:15,760
I'll go, then.

60
00:05:17,560 -- 00:05:20,480
I'll not be in the same
room as that man.

61
00:06:06,280 -- 00:06:09,000
Come on, Pol, Tommy's expecting us.

62
00:06:10,760 -- 00:06:12,440
Who's with us?

63
00:06:12,440 -- 00:06:14,400
Isaiah and two Lee boys.

64
00:06:16,160 -- 00:06:19,760
Ada, how long
since you've had a fuck?

65
00:06:19,760 -- 00:06:21,640
What?

66
00:06:21,640 -- 00:06:24,680
It's been nearly two years with me.

67
00:06:24,680 -- 00:06:27,160
Over Christmas I counted it up.

68
00:06:27,160 -- 00:06:31,320
So, I've made a New Year's
resolution to change the situation.

69
00:06:31,320 -- 00:06:34,200
Oh. Anyone particular in mind?

70
00:06:34,200 -- 00:06:35,640
Not really.

71
00:06:36,760 -- 00:06:39,800
Just me and someone unsuitable.

72
00:06:42,480 -- 00:06:45,400
♪ From starry eyes colliding

73
00:06:48,800 -- 00:06:52,960
♪ From Mars to someone crying... ♪

74
00:06:54,680 -- 00:06:56,040
I'll sit in the front.

75
00:06:56,040 -- 00:06:58,160
♪ I'm never far away

76
00:07:01,280 -- 00:07:04,520
♪ No matter what I'm hiding

77
00:07:07,760 -- 00:07:09,400
♪ I get lost

78
00:07:10,640 -- 00:07:13,200
♪ But I always come around

79
00:07:14,240 -- 00:07:18,560
♪ Call when you're ready
cos I'm ready to ride. ♪

80
00:07:18,560 -- 00:07:21,200
So, this is just
to make things official.

81
00:07:21,200 -- 00:07:23,960
Your official return
to the company payroll.

82
00:07:23,960 -- 00:07:26,440
So no more talk
of New Year's resolutions

83
00:07:26,440 -- 00:07:28,320
or Tommy might change his mind.

84
00:07:28,320 -- 00:07:30,800
What New Year's resolution?
Never mind.

85
00:07:32,720 -- 00:07:35,200
I think Ada's trying to tell me
to behave myself.

86
00:07:35,200 -- 00:07:37,160
Yeah. Behave yourself.

87
00:07:38,520 -- 00:07:39,720
Behave myself or what?

88
00:07:41,720 -- 00:07:43,960
Behave myself or fucking what?

89
00:07:45,640 -- 00:07:48,040
OK, Polly, I'll tell you the truth.

90
00:07:48,040 -- 00:07:50,960
After your recent troubles, Tommy
asked me to keep an eye on you.

91
00:07:50,960 -- 00:07:52,000
"Troubles?"

92
00:07:53,640 -- 00:07:55,280
Whilst working for this company,

93
00:07:55,280 -- 00:07:56,960
I have killed a man,

94
00:07:56,960 -- 00:07:59,640
I have lost a man,
I have found a son,

95
00:07:59,640 -- 00:08:03,080
I have nearly lost a son,
I have nearly lost my own life.

96
00:08:04,080 -- 00:08:07,400
Now, I will accept my job back,

97
00:08:07,400 -- 00:08:10,440
if the terms on offer
are favourable...

98
00:08:12,880 -- 00:08:14,960
..but I will not behave myself.

99
00:08:28,360 -- 00:08:30,080
Sorry I'm late.

100
00:08:39,120 -- 00:08:40,480
Where's Arthur?

101
00:08:42,760 -- 00:08:44,720
Do I look like his fucking mother?

102
00:08:59,520 -- 00:09:03,240
Oh, no. Why are you here?

103
00:09:03,240 -- 00:09:05,480
You all right? Is Billy all right?

104
00:09:05,480 -- 00:09:07,560
Yes. Everything's fine.

105
00:09:07,560 -- 00:09:10,800
Well, look... Lovely to see you,
but I'm late for a meeting.

106
00:09:10,800 -- 00:09:12,320
They can wait.

107
00:09:19,320 -- 00:09:21,520
I've got something for you.

108
00:09:21,520 -- 00:09:25,800
Something for a loving husband
who's been working very hard...

109
00:09:25,800 -- 00:09:28,520
..and is under a great
deal of pressure.

110
00:09:31,720 -- 00:09:35,800
Something to relieve his stress.

111
00:09:43,400 -- 00:09:46,440
It's silk. From Japan.

112
00:09:46,440 -- 00:09:48,480
Feel.

113
00:09:53,360 -- 00:09:55,280
My hands are dirty.

114
00:09:55,280 -- 00:09:56,960
Good.

115
00:09:56,960 -- 00:09:58,800
Feel all of it.

116
00:10:00,880 -- 00:10:02,560
Feel it properly.

117
00:10:09,880 -- 00:10:13,880
You, er... You want to do this here?

118
00:10:13,880 -- 00:10:17,240
Why not? I thought
you were the boss.

119
00:10:18,560 -- 00:10:22,200
I am the fucking boss.
Then tell me what to do, boss.

120
00:10:24,560 -- 00:10:25,840
Come here.

121
00:10:25,840 -- 00:10:30,040
Right, before we start this
extraordinary general meeting

122
00:10:30,040 -- 00:10:33,360
of the board of the Shelby
Company Limited,

123
00:10:33,360 -- 00:10:37,000
I'd like to note the absence
of the Deputy Vice President,

124
00:10:37,000 -- 00:10:38,560
who has not yet arrived.

125
00:10:38,560 -- 00:10:40,800
We'll continue without his presence.

126
00:10:40,800 -- 00:10:43,240
Item number one.

127
00:10:43,240 -- 00:10:49,040
The reinstatement of the Shelby
Company Limited company treasurer.

128
00:10:49,040 -- 00:10:51,600
The board welcomes back
the former treasurer,

129
00:10:51,600 -- 00:10:54,640
with generously improved
terms and conditions.

130
00:10:54,640 -- 00:10:57,280
Due to the exceptionally
difficult circumstances

131
00:10:57,280 -- 00:10:59,080
the company now finds itself in.

132
00:10:59,080 -- 00:11:02,520
The proposed treasurer will now
check the terms and conditions,

133
00:11:02,520 -- 00:11:03,880
to see if they are in order.

134
00:11:05,440 -- 00:11:09,440
Item number two, during the absence
of the Company Accountant,

135
00:11:09,440 -- 00:11:10,600
due to ill health,

136
00:11:10,600 -- 00:11:14,360
all responsibility for the keeping
of the Company Accounts

137
00:11:14,360 -- 00:11:16,520
pass to the head of acquisitions.

138
00:11:18,440 -- 00:11:21,760
Item number three.
The Company Treasurer,

139
00:11:21,760 -- 00:11:23,800
having read the terms and condition,

140
00:11:23,800 -- 00:11:25,920
lodges a signed contract
of employment agreeing

141
00:11:25,920 -- 00:11:28,760
to the terms and conditions
with the temporary head of accounts.

142
00:11:28,760 -- 00:11:32,560
All those in favour of the
reinstatement of Mrs Elizabeth Gray

143
00:11:32,560 -- 00:11:34,960
to the position of The Shelby
Company treasurer,

144
00:11:34,960 -- 00:11:36,760
please raise your hands.

145
00:11:38,200 -- 00:11:39,840
Why, goodness. Thank you.

146
00:11:39,840 -- 00:11:41,640
Any other business?

147
00:11:41,640 -- 00:11:46,320
Right, I declare this extraordinary
general meeting over.

148
00:11:47,840 -- 00:11:49,480
Now we talk about
the real business...

149
00:11:50,560 -- 00:11:52,520
..but, for that, we need Arthur.

150
00:11:52,520 -- 00:11:54,360
Where the fuck is Arthur?

151
00:12:17,720 -- 00:12:20,240
Mr Shelby! Fuck off.

152
00:12:20,240 -- 00:12:22,920
They've broken into the paint shop.
Oh, yeah?

153
00:12:22,920 -- 00:12:24,600
They're chucking paint around -

154
00:12:24,600 -- 00:12:26,440
I think they mean
to set light to it.

155
00:12:26,440 -- 00:12:30,480
Well, you deal with it, man,
I'm fucking busy!

156
00:12:55,000 -- 00:12:57,040
What was all that about?

157
00:13:12,920 -- 00:13:15,440
In this sinful place,

158
00:13:15,440 -- 00:13:17,760
there will be temptations.

159
00:13:17,760 -- 00:13:19,960
It's my responsibility as your wife

160
00:13:19,960 -- 00:13:22,480
to help you resist
those temptations.

161
00:13:23,800 -- 00:13:26,840
By putting myself between you...

162
00:13:31,600 -- 00:13:33,000
..and the devil.

163
00:13:35,240 -- 00:13:38,000
In the words of my sinful
Catholic mother,

164
00:13:38,000 -- 00:13:41,440
"Keep his balls empty
and his belly full."

165
00:13:43,120 -- 00:13:44,800
God rest her soul.

166
00:13:46,360 -- 00:13:48,320
Mr Shelby!

167
00:13:48,320 -- 00:13:51,440
You have to come to the
paint shop immediately! Please!

168
00:13:55,520 -- 00:13:57,080
Oh, I have to go.

169
00:13:57,080 -- 00:13:59,760
Won't be late.

170
00:14:05,120 -- 00:14:07,520
Sorry, ladies,
there's no smoking in here.

171
00:14:07,520 -- 00:14:09,360
Yes, love, we know.

172
00:14:11,680 -- 00:14:14,480
All right. He's an hour late.
Fuck him.

173
00:14:15,560 -- 00:14:19,520
This business directly affects
Arthur, but he's not here,

174
00:14:19,520 -- 00:14:21,320
so we'll take a vote without him.

175
00:14:21,320 -- 00:14:23,640
What business?

176
00:14:23,640 -- 00:14:26,320
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

177
00:14:26,320 -- 00:14:31,400
An informant told us
that six years ago Luca Changretta

178
00:14:31,400 -- 00:14:34,760
came from New York to Birmingham to
be best man at his cousin's wedding.

179
00:14:34,760 -- 00:14:37,560
We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn in Broadgate

180
00:14:37,560 -- 00:14:38,760
for the photographs.

181
00:14:38,760 -- 00:14:43,280
The photographer kept the negatives.
I persuaded him to give us copies...

182
00:14:43,280 -- 00:14:44,640
..and to enlarge this one.

183
00:14:46,760 -- 00:14:50,080
That is Luca Changretta.

184
00:14:50,080 -- 00:14:52,800
I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

185
00:14:52,800 -- 00:14:55,640
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

186
00:14:55,640 -- 00:14:59,000
which means the chances are
they're the men will come kill us.

187
00:14:59,000 -- 00:15:00,960
We need to get both these
photographs

188
00:15:00,960 -- 00:15:02,680
into pubs and on street corners,

189
00:15:02,680 -- 00:15:06,240
and put it about that there's
a reward for information.

190
00:15:08,840 -- 00:15:12,520
We also propose that we give
a copy of this photograph

191
00:15:12,520 -- 00:15:14,600
to Mr Aberama Gold.

192
00:15:14,600 -- 00:15:17,800
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur

193
00:15:17,800 -- 00:15:21,480
that pulls the trigger.
Tradition will just fuck us up.

194
00:15:21,480 -- 00:15:23,200
We should wait for Arthur.

195
00:15:23,200 -- 00:15:25,360
Arthur's not here, Ada.

196
00:15:25,360 -- 00:15:29,240
We need Luca Changretta dead.
That's it.

197
00:15:29,240 -- 00:15:32,520
Dropping the law of the bullet is
part of the process of modernisation

198
00:15:32,520 -- 00:15:34,320
that I was working on
before I were...

199
00:15:35,400 -- 00:15:37,360
..before I was executed.

200
00:15:37,360 -- 00:15:38,960
You weren't executed, Pol.

201
00:15:40,120 -- 00:15:41,560
What did you call me?

202
00:15:41,560 -- 00:15:44,160
Right. Let's take a vote.
I'll deal with Arthur.

203
00:15:44,160 -- 00:15:47,080
All those in favour of giving
the photographs

204
00:15:47,080 -- 00:15:48,840
to Mr Gold raise your hand.

205
00:16:01,360 -- 00:16:03,120
Then it will be done.

206
00:16:03,120 -- 00:16:05,520
Mum... Oh, "mum" now, is it?

207
00:16:06,720 -- 00:16:08,640
I smelt perfume when I came in here.

208
00:16:08,640 -- 00:16:09,920
Yeah, it was the flowers.

209
00:16:11,320 -- 00:16:12,720
Right, that's it.

210
00:16:12,720 -- 00:16:14,280
Who came in here, Michael?

211
00:16:14,280 -- 00:16:18,560
The truth is, Polly, the woman
that raised him came in here.

212
00:16:18,560 -- 00:16:20,040
She has every right to come in here.

213
00:16:20,040 -- 00:16:22,000
She brought him fucking apples
and she left.

214
00:16:22,000 -- 00:16:24,760
We're in the middle of a vendetta
and Arthur's missing.

215
00:16:24,760 -- 00:16:26,240
We need to find him.

216
00:16:26,240 -- 00:16:29,240
Concentrate on what unites us.

217
00:16:29,240 -- 00:16:30,920
This is all temporary.

218
00:16:30,920 -- 00:16:32,480
Yeah, temporary, right.

219
00:16:42,640 -- 00:16:45,720

226

227
00:17:12,840 -- 00:17:16,680
What's this, a party, eh?
Fuck off out of it!

228
00:17:16,680 -- 00:17:18,320
Get out!

229
00:17:23,800 -- 00:17:28,560
OK, I wasn't going to hit ya...
but that wasn't fucking nice.

230
00:17:32,960 -- 00:17:34,840
Oh, you...

231
00:17:39,440 -- 00:17:41,600
Arthur! Mr Shelby!
Please, Mr Shelby! Please.

232
00:17:41,600 -- 00:17:47,880
Don't fucking move.
Eh? Eh? Now get the fuck out!

233
00:17:50,000 -- 00:17:52,720
Fuck you and fuck your revolution!

234
00:18:02,360 -- 00:18:04,640
I'm a fucking mess.

235
00:19:30,720 -- 00:19:32,160
Where are you going?

236
00:19:32,160 -- 00:19:33,560
Come here.

237
00:19:33,560 -- 00:19:35,080
Fucking hit man, are you?

238
00:19:35,080 -- 00:19:37,240
Is that what you are?

239
00:19:38,880 -- 00:19:40,680
Arthur Shelby, hey!

240
00:19:40,680 -- 00:19:42,400
Let's see who wanted you.

241
00:19:44,120 -- 00:19:45,160
What about...

242
00:19:46,520 -- 00:19:48,800
What about fucking John Shelby?

243
00:20:15,920 -- 00:20:17,480
John.

244
00:21:01,640 -- 00:21:03,200
Thank you.

245
00:21:03,200 -- 00:21:05,800
Send my guests in.

246
00:21:50,600 -- 00:21:54,120
You wire Polo and let him
tell the family.

247
00:21:56,200 -- 00:21:58,080
He has four kids.

248
00:22:07,000 -- 00:22:10,160
Don't you two have any other
clothes to wear?

249
00:22:10,160 -- 00:22:11,360
Uh?

250
00:22:19,440 -- 00:22:20,960
Look at me.

251
00:22:20,960 -- 00:22:23,240
Huh?

252
00:22:23,240 -- 00:22:25,840
I'm here as a lover of theatre.

253
00:22:51,200 -- 00:22:53,160
They kill two of our men...

254
00:22:56,840 -- 00:22:59,160
..you complain about
your fucking belly.

255
00:23:02,400 -- 00:23:03,520
Luca.

256
00:23:05,040 -- 00:23:08,160
Luca, con tutto rispetto...

257
00:23:08,160 -- 00:23:11,040
With respect... "With respect?"

258
00:23:11,040 -- 00:23:12,720
You raised.

259
00:23:15,640 -- 00:23:17,560
"With respect?"

260
00:23:18,880 -- 00:23:20,280
Open your mouth.

261
00:23:20,280 -- 00:23:21,680
Come on...

262
00:23:21,680 -- 00:23:23,400
Open your fucking mouth!

263
00:23:24,800 -- 00:23:26,840
You fucking dress like them.

264
00:23:26,840 -- 00:23:28,840
You eat like them.

265
00:23:28,840 -- 00:23:31,800
You don't fucking talk to me
about "with respect".

266
00:23:51,720 -- 00:23:53,320
Sit down.

267
00:24:03,200 -- 00:24:04,280
What do you have?

268
00:24:15,200 -- 00:24:18,240
Arthur Shelby killed her
son in a boxing ring four years ago.

269
00:24:33,960 -- 00:24:35,440
She would do that for us?

270
00:24:46,520 -- 00:24:47,920
OK.

271
00:25:16,040 -- 00:25:17,680
Anyone seen Arthur?

272
00:25:20,320 -- 00:25:22,720
Anyone seen Arthur? Hey?

273
00:25:22,720 -- 00:25:24,520
In your office, Tom.

274
00:25:30,440 -- 00:25:32,920
If you're not going to show up
for a family meeting,

275
00:25:32,920 -- 00:25:35,360
you let someone know.
We thought you were dead,

276
00:25:35,360 -- 00:25:38,160
there's 15 fucking
Italians out there.

277
00:25:38,160 -- 00:25:41,280
No, there's not, there's 13.

278
00:25:41,280 -- 00:25:44,240
I just killed two of them.

279
00:25:44,240 -- 00:25:48,400
Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

280
00:25:51,000 -- 00:25:52,520
I did it.

281
00:25:53,440 -- 00:25:55,960
Me. Your brother.

282
00:25:57,040 -- 00:26:00,320
Not fucking Aberama Gold
or his punch-drunk son.

283
00:26:00,320 -- 00:26:02,160
But me!

284
00:26:03,680 -- 00:26:06,640
Even if you don't trust me no more.

285
00:26:06,640 -- 00:26:09,080
What the fuck are you talking about?
Arthur?

286
00:26:10,560 -- 00:26:11,960
I got cleaned up at Ada's.

287
00:26:13,480 -- 00:26:16,800
She told me,
you took a vote in my absence.

288
00:26:16,800 -- 00:26:20,360
All right, calm down and
tell me about the men you killed.

289
00:26:20,360 -- 00:26:23,000
You put my job out for contract.

290
00:26:23,000 -- 00:26:24,400
Arthur...

291
00:26:24,400 -- 00:26:27,720
Yeah, well, I'm going to make it
my fucking job anyway.

292
00:26:27,720 -- 00:26:29,640
Because this was all my fault.

293
00:26:29,640 -- 00:26:33,440
It was me that shot the old man...
Yeah, out of mercy.

294
00:26:34,960 -- 00:26:36,720
Aye, now John's dead,

295
00:26:36,720 -- 00:26:40,600
he's dead because of me,
and I want to make it right.

296
00:26:40,600 -- 00:26:42,520
Arthur, wait.

297
00:26:44,360 -- 00:26:46,520
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

298
00:26:50,960 -- 00:26:53,240
Through the back fucking door

299
00:26:53,240 -- 00:26:56,840
that was supposed to be locked
and bolted.

300
00:26:56,840 -- 00:27:01,320
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

301
00:27:02,880 -- 00:27:07,200
Yeah. Why don't you sit there
and work it out for yourself?

302
00:27:09,240 -- 00:27:11,080
And take a fucking vote.

303
00:27:27,280 -- 00:27:30,520
Who is this little bear? Yes?

304
00:27:30,520 -- 00:27:32,120
Eh?

305
00:27:35,440 -- 00:27:37,200
Are you all right?

306
00:27:40,960 -- 00:27:43,520
Daddy's home, Billy.

307
00:27:43,520 -- 00:27:47,760
Yeah, I'm all right.
Look, Daddy's home.

308
00:27:49,480 -- 00:27:50,920
How's Polly?

309
00:27:52,960 -- 00:27:54,640
Is she all right?

310
00:27:58,200 -- 00:28:04,080
Oh, go on, Linda.
I mean, it was her idea, wasn't it?

311
00:28:04,080 -- 00:28:07,360
Hum? The Japanese silk?

312
00:28:08,440 -- 00:28:10,000
I'll put him to bed.

313
00:28:20,720 -- 00:28:23,560
You kept me away
from that fucking meeting

314
00:28:23,560 -- 00:28:26,440
to stop me from voting. Here we go.

315
00:28:26,440 -- 00:28:28,960
It was Polly's idea, wasn't it?

316
00:28:28,960 -- 00:28:30,400
Eh?

317
00:28:31,400 -- 00:28:35,400
You know what I am, don't ya?
I am a working man.

318
00:28:36,640 -- 00:28:38,080
Yeah.

319
00:28:39,280 -- 00:28:41,320
Fucking working man.

320
00:28:42,680 -- 00:28:45,720
Fucking... who's lost his job.

321
00:28:50,160 -- 00:28:52,240
Is that what I am, Linda?

322
00:28:52,240 -- 00:28:53,920
Is that what I am, eh?

323
00:28:56,040 -- 00:29:00,440
I don't want you dead.
Polly doesn't want you dead.

324
00:29:00,440 -- 00:29:03,480
Let Mr Gold do the killing.
For money.

325
00:29:03,480 -- 00:29:05,680
It's the modern way, Arthur.

326
00:29:09,080 -- 00:29:10,520
Watch.

327
00:29:22,200 -- 00:29:23,360
What are you doing?

328
00:29:26,040 -- 00:29:28,960
Now fire it into the fireplace.

329
00:29:28,960 -- 00:29:30,560
Please.

330
00:29:34,120 -- 00:29:36,640
All right. Fire it.

331
00:29:38,440 -- 00:29:39,960
Get rid of it.

332
00:29:45,520 -- 00:29:46,960
Then we'll go to bed.

333
00:29:48,160 -- 00:29:49,840
Do anything you like.

334
00:29:51,240 -- 00:29:53,280
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

335
00:29:54,360 -- 00:29:55,760
Fire it.

336
00:29:57,640 -- 00:29:59,520
You go tell Polly...

337
00:30:01,960 -- 00:30:05,560
..there are rules
between a man and women.

338
00:30:06,880 -- 00:30:08,680
Fucking rules.

339
00:30:14,720 -- 00:30:16,600
That I have to do this.

340
00:30:19,840 -- 00:30:21,480
I have to do it.

341
00:30:24,200 -- 00:30:27,240
John wants me to do it, Linda.

342
00:30:30,520 -- 00:30:31,920
My brother.

343
00:30:34,360 -- 00:30:36,600
And I'm going to do it.

344
00:31:24,040 -- 00:31:25,800
Was it fear, or was it hatred?

345
00:31:27,680 -- 00:31:31,200
Was what fear or hatred? Isaiah...

346
00:31:38,840 -- 00:31:41,440
You had a one way ticket
to Glasgow in your pocket.

347
00:31:45,440 -- 00:31:48,280
Your wife and kids
left three days ago.

348
00:31:49,560 -- 00:31:52,400
Now... I'm going to ask you again.

349
00:31:55,640 -- 00:32:00,000
Was it fear of the Italians,
or hatred of us

350
00:32:00,000 -- 00:32:04,200
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

351
00:32:04,200 -- 00:32:06,120
I didn't unlock any door.

352
00:32:10,520 -- 00:32:12,040
Here, have a drink.

353
00:32:13,520 -- 00:32:15,000
You're going to need it.

354
00:32:18,680 -- 00:32:22,360
35 Drumcree Street,
Parkhead, Glasgow...

355
00:32:22,360 -- 00:32:25,240
Please, please, please, please...

356
00:32:25,240 -- 00:32:29,280
We have allegiances with Catholic
gangs in that city.

357
00:32:29,280 -- 00:32:32,280
Your family are safe
only at my discretion.

358
00:32:33,520 -- 00:32:37,480
Now... explain to me...

359
00:32:37,480 -- 00:32:40,240
..why you were catching
a midnight train to Glasgow.

360
00:32:41,720 -- 00:32:42,960
You mean you don't know?

361
00:32:44,960 -- 00:32:48,440
I run a factory full of blackleg,
non-union labour.

362
00:32:48,440 -- 00:32:51,880
I live in a street full of men
laid off or on strike.

363
00:32:53,400 -- 00:32:55,320
Look at this photograph, Mr Devlin,

364
00:32:55,320 -- 00:32:57,480
and tell me who are the men
who contacted you... No.

365
00:32:57,480 -- 00:32:59,280
No, you listen to me.

366
00:32:59,280 -- 00:33:01,520
I get spat at,

367
00:33:01,520 -- 00:33:04,160
windows smashed,
petrol on the curtains...

368
00:33:04,160 -- 00:33:07,640
..but, for fear of you,
I clock in every fucking morning -

369
00:33:07,640 -- 00:33:11,440
and, today, two men are shot
and burnt on my shift...

370
00:33:11,440 -- 00:33:14,440
..and you ask me why I'm getting
the midnight train to Glasgow?

371
00:33:24,160 -- 00:33:26,480
Who else has the keys to that door?

372
00:33:26,480 -- 00:33:29,040
They hang on a hook
inside my office.

373
00:33:30,440 -- 00:33:32,560
Today, I left the office unlocked.

374
00:33:32,560 -- 00:33:36,200
Why? Because I forgot.
Because I left in a hurry.

375
00:33:36,200 -- 00:33:39,040
Because there were men trying
to set fire to the factory!

376
00:33:41,120 -- 00:33:44,080
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

377
00:33:46,160 -- 00:33:47,600
You have a lot of enemies.

378
00:33:49,320 -- 00:33:50,920
Communists.

379
00:33:50,920 -- 00:33:52,400
Italians.

380
00:33:56,440 -- 00:33:58,960
Before the factory came out
on strike,

381
00:33:58,960 -- 00:34:03,280
I heard word that two Italians
attended a Communist Party meeting

382
00:34:03,280 -- 00:34:06,200
in Stechford.
They hardly spoke English.

383
00:34:07,840 -- 00:34:10,640
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory

384
00:34:10,640 -- 00:34:13,840
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

385
00:34:17,920 -- 00:34:22,040
Mr Shelby... my train leaves at 12.

386
00:34:22,040 -- 00:34:25,000
It's just gone 11.
I could still make it.

387
00:34:27,920 -- 00:34:30,840
Please. For my kids.

388
00:34:37,800 -- 00:34:39,400
I need you here.

389
00:34:39,400 -- 00:34:43,080
Isaiah, get three of our men
with police badges

390
00:34:43,080 -- 00:34:46,440
to watch Mr Devlin's house.
Mr Shelby, please...

391
00:34:49,320 -- 00:34:52,160
Our friends in Glasgow
will take care of your family.

392
00:34:54,120 -- 00:34:55,800
For the curtains.

393
00:34:57,440 -- 00:35:00,840
Before you, I was
an ordinary working man.

394
00:35:00,840 -- 00:35:03,840
Yeah, and now you're one of us.

395
00:35:24,520 -- 00:35:27,120

Who is it?

400
00:36:08,720 -- 00:36:10,240
It's Tommy Shelby.

401
00:36:15,280 -- 00:36:16,800
Is this union business?

402
00:36:16,800 -- 00:36:18,120
Yes.

403
00:36:18,120 -- 00:36:20,440
So, conduct it in the proper
place at the proper time.

404
00:36:20,440 -- 00:36:22,520
I've come to make an improved offer.

405
00:36:34,960 -- 00:36:36,360
I heard music.

406
00:36:37,640 -- 00:36:39,800
What's your improved offer?

407
00:36:39,800 -- 00:36:41,640
Do I not get a drink?

408
00:36:41,640 -- 00:36:43,040
No.

409
00:36:50,400 -- 00:36:54,680
Have you ever seen any of the men
in this photograph before? 

410
00:36:59,480 -- 00:37:03,280
You're a member
of the Stechford Communist party.

411
00:37:03,280 -- 00:37:06,560
I'm told two Italian men
attended a meeting recently.

412
00:37:06,560 -- 00:37:09,560
Can you see either of them
in this picture?

413
00:37:13,560 -- 00:37:15,520
As the Small Heath coordinator

414
00:37:15,520 -- 00:37:18,880
of the Organisation for the
Maintenance of Supplies,

415
00:37:18,880 -- 00:37:21,360
I have also
been sworn in as a Special...

416
00:37:23,440 -- 00:37:27,120
We have reason to believe
that outside agitators from overseas

417
00:37:27,120 -- 00:37:30,080
are attempting to foment
trouble in our factories

418
00:37:30,080 -- 00:37:31,880
in advance of a General Strike,

419
00:37:31,880 -- 00:37:34,040
which could take place
at any moment.

420
00:37:34,040 -- 00:37:36,200
This is a matter
of national security.

421
00:37:37,920 -- 00:37:39,160
May I look at your badge?

422
00:37:40,640 -- 00:37:41,880
Yes.

423
00:37:52,800 -- 00:37:54,840
What would you like to drink,
Constable?

424
00:37:54,840 -- 00:37:57,560
Whisky.
And, actually, it's Sergeant.

425
00:37:57,560 -- 00:38:00,280
I only have beer. Times are hard.

426
00:38:00,280 -- 00:38:03,200
How long has it been since
you've had a bottle of M&B bitter?

427
00:38:04,400 -- 00:38:05,720
Help yourself.

428
00:38:09,240 -- 00:38:10,560
Have a seat.

429
00:38:17,840 -- 00:38:22,280
You know, when this business began,
I did some research on you.

430
00:38:22,280 -- 00:38:25,240
It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

431
00:38:26,720 -- 00:38:28,000
Kitty Jurossi.

432
00:38:32,040 -- 00:38:34,800
You were in love with
Kitty's sister, Greta Jurossi,

433
00:38:34,800 -- 00:38:37,280
before the war.
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

434
00:38:39,240 -- 00:38:41,440
Her parents were Italian.

435
00:38:41,440 -- 00:38:44,000
They didn't approve
of a Watery Lane Gypsy...

436
00:38:44,000 -- 00:38:47,560
..but you won them over.
With your charm.

437
00:38:47,560 -- 00:38:48,600
Sweetness.

438
00:38:51,200 -- 00:38:54,960
Very... Very thorough research.

439
00:38:54,960 -- 00:38:58,960
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption...

440
00:39:00,880 -- 00:39:04,680
..and Kitty said you were
at her bedside for three months.

441
00:39:04,680 -- 00:39:06,600
Every day. Holding her hand...

442
00:39:08,120 -- 00:39:10,400
..and after she died,
you went away to war.

443
00:39:12,320 -- 00:39:15,280
Kitty said that the sweet boy
who left never came back.

444
00:39:15,280 -- 00:39:17,000
No-one came back.

445
00:39:18,400 -- 00:39:20,120
Here's the funniest thing.

446
00:39:21,680 -- 00:39:24,760
She said, in those days,
you believed in things.

447
00:39:24,760 -- 00:39:27,560
In justice. Fairness.

448
00:39:27,560 -- 00:39:30,240
Once you saw a man beating
his horse, and you fought him.

449
00:39:30,240 -- 00:39:32,080
He was twice your size,
but you beat him...

450
00:39:32,080 -- 00:39:34,040
..and then you beat him
with his own whip.

451
00:39:36,120 -- 00:39:38,160
Kitty always liked
to tell tall tales.

452
00:39:39,360 -- 00:39:40,760
She's a party member now.

453
00:39:42,040 -- 00:39:44,200
She swears before you enlisted
in the army

454
00:39:44,200 -- 00:39:46,400
you joined the
Communist Party yourself.

455
00:39:50,280 -- 00:39:51,880
Is that true?

456
00:40:02,280 -- 00:40:04,800
When I was at the door,

457
00:40:04,800 -- 00:40:06,840
I saw you through the curtains.

458
00:40:08,360 -- 00:40:09,920
You were dancing alone.

459
00:40:13,320 -- 00:40:15,600
I've also done my research.

460
00:40:21,480 -- 00:40:24,120
Your sweetheart
was at Passchendaele.

461
00:40:25,800 -- 00:40:28,760
When he came back, he was
listed among the shellshocked.

462
00:40:30,360 -- 00:40:32,400
Blew his own fucking brains out.

463
00:40:41,280 -- 00:40:43,320
I don't know any men in the photo.

464
00:40:47,640 -- 00:40:49,480
You haven't looked.

465
00:40:50,600 -- 00:40:52,960
This afternoon,
two men came into my factory

466
00:40:52,960 -- 00:40:54,840
and tried to kill my brother.

467
00:40:54,840 -- 00:40:57,840
I believe a Stechford
Communist Party member let him in.

468
00:40:57,840 -- 00:41:01,680
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

469
00:41:07,840 -- 00:41:11,960
Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

470
00:41:11,960 -- 00:41:15,040
I should send you her love
from the good old days...

471
00:41:15,040 -- 00:41:16,680
..and give you this.

472
00:41:19,200 -- 00:41:23,520
Greta Jurossi and Tommy Shelby
in Blackpool.

473
00:41:33,080 -- 00:41:35,680
Do you recognise
the boy in the photograph?

474
00:41:58,880 -- 00:42:00,480
I'll leave that here.

475
00:42:04,880 -- 00:42:07,360
Apologies for interrupting
your dance.

The world is changing.

Listen to me, Arthur.

488
00:43:49,960 -- 00:43:54,080
Listen to the sweet
voice of Jesus.

489
00:44:53,920 -- 00:44:56,440
Finn? It came from Arthur's house.

490
00:44:57,920 -- 00:44:59,440
Arthur.

491
00:45:02,280 -- 00:45:03,560
Arthur.

492
00:45:03,560 -- 00:45:05,120
Where is he?

00:45:06,960 -- 00:45:08,280
Arthur?

494
00:45:09,480 -- 00:45:11,240
He fired the bullet.

495
00:45:14,000 -- 00:45:15,440
Linda...

496
00:45:16,920 -- 00:45:20,000
..says it's the modern way, so...

497
00:45:23,000 -- 00:45:24,960
It's the modern way.

498
00:45:24,960 -- 00:45:28,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's all right.

499
00:45:31,520 -- 00:45:33,120
It's all right, brother.

500
00:45:39,080 -- 00:45:40,400
You did well.

501
00:45:40,400 -- 00:45:42,400
God spoke to him, not me.

502
00:46:07,440 -- 00:46:09,000
What are you doing here?

503
00:46:09,000 -- 00:46:10,960
On Mondays, I do the inventory.

504
00:46:10,960 -- 00:46:13,480
Make sure nobody's
dipping their hand.

505
00:46:13,480 -- 00:46:16,880
Well, it's now my job now.

506
00:46:18,200 -- 00:46:19,680
I'm back -

507
00:46:19,680 -- 00:46:22,280
and there's going to be nobody
dipping their hand with me here,

508
00:46:22,280 -- 00:46:24,440
not unless they want it cut off.

509
00:46:35,920 -- 00:46:38,280
I said to Arthur,
while I'm in this fucking place,

510
00:46:38,280 -- 00:46:40,200
I want something to keep
my mind busy.

511
00:46:40,200 -- 00:46:41,840
What? You're going to take bets?

512
00:46:41,840 -- 00:46:44,440
I've always been able to do addition
and subtraction

513
00:46:44,440 -- 00:46:45,640
without pen and paper -

514
00:46:45,640 -- 00:46:47,400
but I'll need a telephone.

515
00:46:47,400 -- 00:46:51,280
Apparently, we have special clients
who take bets by telephone.

516
00:46:51,280 -- 00:46:52,360
Linda?

517
00:46:54,200 -- 00:46:56,240
This is a betting shop.

518
00:46:56,240 -- 00:46:58,280
Look...

519
00:46:58,280 -- 00:47:00,560
..Arthur said yes. Tommy said yes.

520
00:47:00,560 -- 00:47:03,080
But did God say yes?
Gambling is a sin, Linda.

521
00:47:03,080 -- 00:47:05,520
It's not me
that's doing the gambling.

522
00:47:05,520 -- 00:47:07,680
I'm just taking the bets.

523
00:47:17,160 -- 00:47:20,440
The rule is that door should
always remain locked until 9am.

524
00:47:23,120 -- 00:47:26,360
Right. Boy.
Boy, where are you going?

525
00:47:26,360 -- 00:47:29,560
Well, Arthur's not coming in today.
He's taking the day off.

526
00:47:29,560 -- 00:47:31,600
So... So what?

527
00:47:31,600 -- 00:47:34,720
So, today,
Tommy said that I'm in charge.

528
00:47:34,720 -- 00:47:36,520
Sorry, you're in charge?

529
00:47:38,160 -- 00:47:39,880
Yeah. That's what he said.

530
00:47:44,000 -- 00:47:46,120
All right, sweetheart.

531
00:47:49,400 -- 00:47:56,440
Ladies, let's give our boss a first
day that he'll never forget.

532
00:48:06,320 -- 00:48:08,520
Sending Finn to the shop
was a mistake.

533
00:48:08,520 -- 00:48:11,720
They've already found out he's a
virgin and they're arranging

534
00:48:11,720 -- 00:48:13,320
a girl for him this afternoon.

535
00:48:13,320 -- 00:48:15,120
I thought Linda was there.

536
00:48:15,120 -- 00:48:17,480
She is. She loved the idea.

537
00:48:18,720 -- 00:48:20,720
Yeah, I know. She even swears now.

538
00:48:20,720 -- 00:48:23,800
"Fuck" sounds funny coming from her.

539
00:48:23,800 -- 00:48:26,240
Polly says in the end
we all turn into our mother.

540
00:48:26,240 -- 00:48:28,800
Ah, well, keep an eye on her.

541
00:48:31,000 -- 00:48:33,240
The whore watching the Madonna.

542
00:48:33,240 -- 00:48:36,680
Does Finn know what
they've planned? No.

543
00:48:36,680 -- 00:48:38,760
Do they have someone?

544
00:48:38,760 -- 00:48:41,880
Yes. A girl I used to work with.

545
00:48:44,440 -- 00:48:48,120
Is she nice? No. She's from Aston.

546
00:48:48,120 -- 00:48:50,400
They're paying her
out of petty cash.

547
00:48:50,400 -- 00:48:55,920
Right, well, call 'em and tell them
to pay extra and get someone nice.

548
00:48:57,040 -- 00:49:01,600
Nice women don't do that sort of
thing. Yes, they do. What a

549
00:49:04,800 -- 00:49:07,640
I mean, in the past. Come on.

550
00:49:07,640 -- 00:49:09,320
Where are we going?

551
00:49:09,320 -- 00:49:11,680
Somewhere I've not
been in a long time.

552
00:49:30,560 -- 00:49:32,120
Are we expecting somebody?

553
00:49:35,560 -- 00:49:37,600
Tommy, I'm fucking freezing here.

554
00:49:40,400 -- 00:49:41,880
We used to come here.

555
00:49:44,640 -- 00:49:48,320
She'd wait for hours for me,
when I couldn't make it...

556
00:49:50,280 -- 00:49:54,120
..and I'd wait for her,
if her family kept her in.

557
00:49:56,200 -- 00:49:57,360
Who?

558
00:49:59,920 -- 00:50:01,040
Some girl.

559
00:50:02,600 -- 00:50:03,880
Some girl before France.

560
00:50:09,560 -- 00:50:11,440
I've not been back here since...

561
00:50:18,080 -- 00:50:19,800
..but I wanted to come here
with you.

562
00:50:32,160 -- 00:50:34,000
Are you kissing her or me?

563
00:50:36,800 -- 00:50:38,160
You.

564
00:51:23,840 -- 00:51:26,080
I want Shelby Company Limited

565
00:51:26,080 -- 00:51:30,800
to increase non-taxable charitable
contributions to local charities

566
00:51:30,800 -- 00:51:33,240
by 25% as of now...

567
00:51:34,480 -- 00:51:39,160
..and I'm going to build two new
institutes for destitute children.

568
00:51:39,160 -- 00:51:41,800
One in Saltley, one in Digbeth.

569
00:51:41,800 -- 00:51:44,160
I've already identified
the buildings.

570
00:51:44,160 -- 00:51:45,840
Two former workhouses.

571
00:51:47,840 -- 00:51:49,720
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

572
00:51:52,160 -- 00:51:53,960
Right, come on, let's go.

573
00:51:53,960 -- 00:51:55,440
Why?

574
00:52:02,920 -- 00:52:05,920
Because I promised someone
I was going to change the world.

575
00:52:09,640 -- 00:52:12,920
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

576
00:52:12,920 -- 00:52:17,160
Yeah, I know. Come on.

577
00:52:29,840 -- 00:52:32,440
Finn? Come here.

578
00:52:36,600 -- 00:52:38,120
How was your day?

579
00:52:38,120 -- 00:52:39,600
Yeah, it was OK.

580
00:52:41,280 -- 00:52:43,000
Good man. Well done.

581
00:52:43,000 -- 00:52:44,640
No trouble?

582
00:52:44,640 -- 00:52:46,640
No. No trouble.

583
00:52:48,880 -- 00:52:50,520
And she looked after you?

584
00:52:55,440 -- 00:52:58,440
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

585
00:52:58,440 -- 00:53:01,800
Not when they don't even want to
do it, except for the money.

586
00:53:02,880 -- 00:53:06,640
Everything's for the money, Finn.
Yeah, I know. But, er...

587
00:53:09,280 -- 00:53:10,720
She said "be a man".

588
00:53:12,600 -- 00:53:14,040
And were you a man?

589
00:53:15,120 -- 00:53:16,480
Yeah...

590
00:53:18,000 -- 00:53:21,680
..but then I apologised to her,
cos she just looked so tired.

591
00:53:25,200 -- 00:53:26,600
Sit down, Finn.

592
00:53:30,680 -- 00:53:34,760
Right, listen to me, Finn.
She was right.

593
00:53:36,200 -- 00:53:37,600
You need to be a fucking man.

594
00:53:38,640 -- 00:53:40,560
People get tired.

595
00:53:40,560 -- 00:53:42,800
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

596
00:53:42,800 -- 00:53:46,360
I don't go round apologising. Do I?

597
00:53:46,360 -- 00:53:47,400
No.

598
00:53:47,400 -- 00:53:49,400
There's an empty space here
to be filled.

599
00:53:49,400 -- 00:53:53,040
Do you understand? Yeah.

600
00:53:53,040 -- 00:53:55,200
So, be a fucking man.

601
00:53:58,360 -- 00:53:59,400
OK, Tom.

602
00:54:43,200 -- 00:54:45,200
Champagne, please. Of course.

603
00:54:47,200 -- 00:54:52,640
Madam, women alone
are not allowed at the bar.

604
00:54:52,640 -- 00:54:54,720
Will someone be joining you?

605
00:54:54,720 -- 00:54:56,800
What do you think?

606
00:55:42,440 -- 00:55:44,040
This is public enough, no?

607
00:55:45,720 -- 00:55:47,640
Yes.

608
00:55:49,720 -- 00:55:51,400
So?

609
00:55:53,240 -- 00:55:55,680
The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds...

610
00:55:55,680 -- 00:55:58,080
..and I'll ask you to spare
Finn and Arthur.

611
00:56:00,920 -- 00:56:03,360
In return for what?

612
00:56:07,840 -- 00:56:09,520
Tommy Shelby.

613
00:56:16,280 -- 00:56:17,920
And, er, why should I trust you?

614
00:56:20,360 -- 00:56:21,880
Because you know our history.

615
00:56:24,480 -- 00:56:26,720
You know what happened between us.

616
00:56:29,440 -- 00:56:32,200
You are an unlikely Cassius.

617
00:56:39,640 -- 00:56:42,880
You know, my mother...

618
00:56:42,880 -- 00:56:45,400
My mother knew your mother.

619
00:56:47,240 -- 00:56:49,680
She taught her how to read.

620
00:56:52,000 -- 00:56:55,240
Did she tell you that John
and Arthur spared her life?

621
00:56:55,240 -- 00:56:56,640
When Tommy wanted her dead.

622
00:56:58,600 -- 00:57:02,320
Yeah - and now she's giving me
the information about you people.

623
00:57:04,280 -- 00:57:06,720
So, Tommy Shelby was right.

624
00:57:08,960 -- 00:57:15,280
His ruthlessness... was justified.

625
00:57:16,800 -- 00:57:20,360
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

626
00:57:22,160 -- 00:57:23,960
John was a good boy.

627
00:57:27,200 -- 00:57:29,320
Arthur tries.

628
00:57:31,320 -- 00:57:32,640
Tommy's different.

629
00:57:34,720 -- 00:57:37,760
You take Tommy. Spare the rest.

630
00:57:42,360 -- 00:57:47,920
You know, my mother used
to say this about you.

631
00:57:48,960 -- 00:57:51,920
She said, "That Polly Gray,

632
00:57:51,920 -- 00:57:56,240
"that child would never let
go of a grievance...

633
00:58:01,040 -- 00:58:02,680
"..and she loves to dance."

634
00:58:07,800 -- 00:58:09,880
What do you say, hm?

635
00:58:09,880 -- 00:58:11,840
You want to dance?

636
00:58:17,960 -- 00:58:19,560
I don't dance any more.

637
00:58:21,920 -- 00:58:23,920
Yeah, that's a shame...

638
00:58:31,400 -- 00:58:33,400
..cos you're dancing with me.
