00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,984
# You were meant for me. #

3
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:05,940
Don't play that, Applejack.

4
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,941
# I was meant for.... #

5
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:12,337
- I'm leaving.
- Julie!

6
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,447
Would you go down to the station
and get me a ticket on the 11:00?

7
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,448
And cash that check for me.

8
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:20,597
Smith will do it for you.

9
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:22,647
And I'd like you to drive me
to the train.

10
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,579
Julie, you'd better think this over.

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,580
I have been thinking it over,
Applejack.

12
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,600
I've been thinking about it for days.

13
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,038
You and Roger have been
married a long time.

14
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,764
We don't need each other anymore.

15
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:35,848
When that happens to two people...

16
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:37,849
nothing left.

17
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:47,208
# You were meant for me. #

18
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:53,409
# I was meant for you. #

19
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,410
# for you... for you... for... #

20
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:08,601
# You were meant for me. #

21
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:14,602
# I was meant for you. #

22
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:25,103
# for you... for you... for you... #

23
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:33,803
# You're like a plaintiff melody. #

24
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:42,004
# That never lets me free. #

25
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:49,840
# For I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

26
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:56,721
# and they meant you just for me. #

27
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,648
What can I do for you?

28
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,760
- The record department.
- They're right here.

29
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,720
How about that one up there,
that book?

30
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,044
- Beethoven?
- Yes, the furthest one, see?

31
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,167
Number seven.

32
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,567
Oh, you keep them down here.

33
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,765
- Needles?
- No, no.

34
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:32,368
- Who plays the sheet music here?
- I do.

35
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,286
-Oh, you do that?
-Hm-hmm.

36
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:39,762
-Would you mind playing that for me?
-Certainly, I'd be glad to.

37
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,804
# ...plaintiff melody. #

38
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:51,380
# And I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

39
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:58,841
# and they meant you just for me. #

40
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,261
New tune, isn't it?

41
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,362
I beg your pardon?

42
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,488
It's a new tune.

43
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:10,802
Oh, I didn't hear you.
Yes, it just came in.

44
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:17,720
-Would be nice to dance to.
-It is.

45
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,519
-What's on the other side?
- It's another new one.

46
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,921
- Would you mind playing it for me?
- No.

47
00:05:26,922 --> 00:05:28,322
This way.

48
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:46,362
# For I'm content the angels
must have sent you #

49
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:55,841
# and they meant you just for me. #

50
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,841
- Good night.
- Good night.

51
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:14,240
Buy a flower, mister.

52
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,118
I'm going this way, honest.

53
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,765
I'm going this way, too, honest.

54
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,800
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

55
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:47,403
- I live here, that's all.
- Oh.

56
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:51,645
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

57
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,346
Oh...

58
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,520
Would you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

59
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,278
Guess not.

60
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,767
- Have you got a victrola inside?

61
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,968
Why, yes, of course.

62
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:10,848
Would you let me hear this one?

63
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,929
Otherwise I'll have to take it home
and imagine how it sounds.

64
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,958
- Don't you have a machine at home?
- No.

65
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,843
Well, why on earth did you buy 27...?

66
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,440
# In my dreams it seems #

67
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:47,941
# your face is near to me... #

68
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:51,242
# and it's dear to me #

69
00:07:51,969 --> 00:08:04,404
# oh, it's just a memory. #

70
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:52,682
What are you thinking about?

71
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:55,720
That it's our song they're playing.

72
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,117
At least that's what you said
when we were dancing.

73
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,998
What are you thinking about?

74
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:05,403
Oh, just wishing.

75
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,520
Wishing I could be with you
every day like this.

76
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,324
I mean, I wish everyday could be
a holiday like this.

77
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:17,143
I mean, never have to go back home,
never have to go to work.

78
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:19,547
It would be perfect, wouldn't it?

79
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,261
- What's it say?
- Oh, nothing. It's silly.

80
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,539
- Come on.
- No, really. It' s silly.

81
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:45,583
Those things are a lot of bunk,
they never come true.

82
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,267
Go on, beat it.

83
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,098
You don't like kids very much,
do you?

84
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,379
Oh, I like them, all right,
except when they're pests.

85
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,258
- What does it say?
- Hm?

86
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,787
- Come on.
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

87
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,661
Come on, tell me.

88
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:26,662
Come on.

89
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,181
Unromantic.

90
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:41,899
I thought you said we'd have
the place to ourselves.

91
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,418
Oh, just the ocean.
The beach I couldn't get.

92
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:46,864
Hey, you're doing all right.

93
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,865
Two or three more lessons
and you'll be able to swim.

94
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,463
You can almost float now.

95
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,185
When your arms are holding me up.

96
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:55,260
When you're with me, you're safe.

97
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,259
I don't know whether it's safe or not.

98
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:10,219
I'm darned if I do either.

99
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,867
It must be getting late.
Let's get dressed.

100
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,388
No, there's plenty of time.

101
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,659
I'm thinking about that last train home.

102
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,538
Come on, Roger.
Get dressed.

103
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:25,999
All right.

104
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,404
It's raining.

105
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:44,482
Put them someplace where
I can grab them faster.

106
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:46,383
I don't belong here.

107
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:48,803
Of course you belong here.
Didn't I invite you?

108
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,199
Come on in and meet
some of my friends.

109
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Night's cold...
Is there a drink in the house?

110
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,484
Right off the boat.
That's what the bootlegger said.

111
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,103
- Did he say what boat?
- Well, what boat would you like?

112
00:11:59,104 --> 00:12:01,000
We have all the labels.
Come on, help yourself.

113
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:06,283
-You?
- Never use it.

114
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:20,407
You know, this party
may turn out all right at that.

115
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,164
- Where's Roger?
-I thought maybe you'd know.

116
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:30,264
You're crazy about that reporter,
aren't you?

117
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,447
I'm sort of fond of him.

118
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:35,323
That's bad.

119
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:39,000
I hate seeing a nice girl like you
getting mixed up with a newspaper man.

120
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:41,628
Gosh, you never know
what they're up to.

121
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,079
They can get away with anything,
alibiing their work.

122
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,667
It's a lot of fun docking around
interviewing chorus girls

123
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:52,468
and all that sort of thing.

124
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:57,161
You think it's swell getting married...

125
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:01,368
Applejack, don't worry about me.
I don't need any advice.

126
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,984
I never even thought
about getting married.

127
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:07,581
- No fooling?
- No fooling.

128
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,142
- Well I've been worried sick.
- About what?

129
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,658
I've been telling him for six months
if he doesn't keep away from you

130
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,000
he'll find himself married.

131
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,248
Julie, I've got to talk to you
right away.

132
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,149
Where can we be alone?

133
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,150
I've had a real break.

134
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:59,788
Flynn quit his job over in Tokyo.
He's our Japanese correspondent.

135
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,479
He got fed up with the assignment,
or the weather, or something.

136
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:04,294
Imagine the spot that left the paper in.

137
00:14:04,295 --> 00:14:06,195
Only one man in the Orient
and he walked out on the job.

138
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,195
Darling, you're cold.
Here, put this around you.

139
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:10,513
I'm just so excited.

140
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:13,878
There you are.

141
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,676
You're going to take his place?

142
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,597
That's what they want me to do.

143
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:20,833
I've got a ticket here for a train
that leaves at 3:00 a.m.

144
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,076
Gets me to San Francisco just in time
to catch the next boat for Yokohama.

145
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,991
I can't believe it yet, Julie.
Imagine them picking me.

146
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,132
You're able, Roger.
You have ability.

147
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,733
Anybody can see that.

148
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:37,037
You're going, hm?

149
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:40,155
That's what I want
to talk to you about, honey.

150
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,034
It's a good salary.
Two-year contract.

151
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,558
And I'm more or less my own boss.

152
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,716
It's the kind of opportunity
I've always wanted.

153
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,788
So look, dear, I was wondering...

154
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,434
Listen, little boy.
Of course I want you to go.

155
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,232
If that's what's worrying you,
please don't think...

156
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,317
No, I wasn't worrying about that.

157
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:01,953
I knew you'd want me
to take the job, sure.

158
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:04,154
But, Julie...

159
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:05,874
let's get married.

160
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,716
Let's get married right away, tonight.

161
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,395
I'll be able to send for you in three months.
I'll have the money then.

162
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,755
Three months?
Why the rush to get married now?

163
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,100
Well, do you think I'm going to let
a funny little redhead

164
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,701
like you run around loose here?

165
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:25,949
Suppose some other fellow
came along...

166
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,350
Oh, Julie, I've got to have you.

167
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,638
Until death do us part?

168
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,830
Till death do us part.

169
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:54,312
Happy New Year!

170
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:57,957
Happy New Year!

171
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,237
Happy New Year!

172
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:07,317
I've got a cab waiting.
All we have to do is sign a license.

173
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,232
Happy New Year!

174
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:33,208
For richer or poorer...

175
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,091
For richer or poorer.

176
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,648
in sickness and in health,

177
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,418
In sickness and in health,

178
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,770
to love and to cherish,

179
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,049
to love and to cherish,

180
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,854
till death do us part.

181
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,614
till death do us part.

182
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,653
All aboard.
The ticket.

183
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,132
We made it.

184
00:17:02,099 --> 00:17:05,091
- Well, good bye, Applejack.
- Good bye, boy.

185
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,688
- Keep an eye on Julie for me.
- I sure will, boy.

186
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,500
So long, Dot.
Take good care of her.

187
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:11,894
I will.

188
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:13,695
Good bye.

189
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,297
Good bye, darling.

190
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:19,938
Excuse me a minute.

191
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,170
-Wait for me.
-All right.

192
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,175
Oh, Roger, I can't say good bye.

193
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,017
Here you are, sir.

194
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,327
Thank you.

195
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:34,776
It's not good bye, darling.
It's just see you later.

196
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,277
-Is there anything I can do
for you, boss?

197
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:41,369
-How soon does the train pull out?
- In about three minutes, sir.

198
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,370
Thank you.

199
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,656
Well, Mrs. Adams.

200
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:48,897
Mrs. Adams!
Sounds strange.

201
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,458
Not strange.
It sounds great.

202
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,328
- Does sound great, doesn't it
- Yes, darling.

203
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,333
There's something about a train.

204
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:10,700
I don't know whether it's the way
it looks or the way it smells, or what it is.

205
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:13,358
It always makes me feel
I want to be off somewhere.

206
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:17,533
I know, darling. I always feel
the same way.

207
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,415
Oh, Roger,
I wish this was our honeymoon.

208
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,416
Oh, I do too, darling.

209
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,535
Promise me something, will you?

210
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,289
Promise me never to take it off.

211
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:39,491
I'll never take it off,
no matter what happens.

212
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:41,292
Thank you, darling.

213
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:54,929
Roger, the train's moving.

214
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:56,731
I'll get you off in a minute.

215
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,535
All aboard!.

216
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,334
Write from Yokohama.

217
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,927
Roger.

218
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:45,852
Darling.

219
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,353
Oh, sweet.

220
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,052
Here we are.

221
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,929
- Ours?
- Yours.

222
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,132
Roger, I didn't expect anything like this.

223
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:25,533
It's like something in a dream.

224
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,457
These are our servants,
Cook-San and O'Hanna-San.

225
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,932
How do you do?

226
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,853
-  Hello.
- Hello.

227
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

228
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:37,729
Hello, there.

229
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:42,132
- Hello.
- Hello.

230
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:47,571
- Whose children are they?
- The servant's children. They live here.

231
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,100
I thought you didn't like children.

232
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,729
Who, me? They're all right.
Come on in.

233
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:56,092
How do you like the place?

234
00:21:56,219 --> 00:22:01,170
It's lovely. But it's so luxurious.
How could we afford it?

235
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:03,572
Don't be so practical
when I'm being highly romantic.

236
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,554
Nothing's too good for my little wife.

237
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:07,155
Come on and see it.

238
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,891
- How do you like that?
- It's beautiful.

239
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:13,736
You are sweet.

240
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:16,578
But I would have been satisfied
with anything just to be here.

241
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:19,272
Oh, I know you would, darling.
But only the best for you.

242
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,000
Come on, we have an upstairs
to this house too.

243
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,101
- We have a shinshitsu.
- What's a shinshitsu?

244
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:25,775
Shinshitsu is the Japanese word
for bedroom, believe it or not.

245
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:28,294
That's right, you wrote me
you spoke Japanese.

246
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,713
Roger, it's perfect.

247
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:34,738
Simply perfect.

248
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,297
I thought you'd like it.

249
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:38,998
Hello, there.

250
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,731
Roger, are we going to keep it,
I mean, stay here right along?

251
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,417
Why, certainly.
It's yours.

252
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:47,854
I bought the lease from
an American that went back.

253
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,553
I got the lease, the furniture,
two servants, three kids...

254
00:22:50,554 --> 00:22:52,154
a cat, and her kid.

255
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,937
All for 2,000 yen.

256
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,176
Two thousand yen.
How much is that?

257
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,291
About a thousand dollars.

258
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:01,929
- A thousand dollars.
- That's right.

259
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,831
How in the world did you do it?
I mean...

260
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,532
get the money to send to me
and buy all this too?

261
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:10,278
- I got an advance.
- Advance?

262
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,055
Sure. An advance on the salary.
Everybody does out here.

263
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,218
Only the other day a fellow
down at the office was saying...

264
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,009
he wished April was here.

265
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:20,272
And I said why?

266
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,993
And he said, so I could get an advance
on my December salary.

267
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:30,900
Oh, now, darling.

268
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:34,573
You're not going to be one of those wives
always worried about money, are you?

269
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:37,013
No, only...

270
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,530
Besides, you forget we still
have the inheritance.

271
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:45,211
Yes, I know, but I'd sort of
hate to start off in debt, especially...

272
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:47,609
You've got a lot to learn
about the Orient.

273
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,574
Roger...

274
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:55,731
Remember this?

275
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,231
Sure, it's one of those fortune things
you got at the beach.

276
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,168
Fancy you keeping that.

277
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:05,093
They're not always the bunk,
you said that.

278
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:07,494
Did I say that?
Well, well.

279
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:10,850
Sometimes, like wishes,
they come true.

280
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:13,174
Sure they do, certainly.

281
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:35,128
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you write me?

282
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,292
You don't like them.

283
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,492
I don't like them?
Why, of course I do.

284
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:42,969
Why would I have three of them
running around the hou...?

285
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:47,369
And this will be our own.
An American kid.

286
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,270
Our own.

287
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:52,537
Gee, that's great.

288
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:57,768
Oh, Roger, I'm so relieved.

289
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,529
You funny little redhead.

290
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:12,372
Very fine kimono.
Very expensive.

291
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:17,575
- Husband must be rich man.
- He's either rich or...

292
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,135
- Moshi moshi!
- Hi!

293
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,290
- What are you doing home
this time of the day?

294
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,001
- What makes you so beautiful. huh?
- How did you get off so early?

295
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,702
Come on, let me see you.

296
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,152
Well, if having babies
makes you look like this

297
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:50,853
we'd better keep on having them.

298
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:53,712
- How do you like it?
- Oh, Roger, I adore it.

299
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,194
Why all this today?
This isn't my birthday.

300
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,284
It's a souvenir.
A souvenir of your stay in Japan...

301
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,668
because, darling, we're leaving.

302
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,632
Leaving Japan?
Hm-hmm.

303
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,600
Now brace yourself for good news,
Mrs. Adams,

304
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:05,701
because good news is what I bring.

305
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:08,100
We now belong to that class of society

306
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,900
known as the filthy rich.

307
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,700
- Roger, the inheritance.
- Yes.

308
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,358
- You got it!
- Yes, mam.

309
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:19,300
- That's wonderful.
- There, now, you see?

310
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:20,801
You didn't believe me about it,
did you?

311
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:23,109
- No, no, I didn't...
- Isn't it great?

312
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,189
Thank you for the dolly.

313
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:30,300
-  Thank you for the ball.
- Oh, that's all right.

314
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,235
I'm teaching him to be a first baseman.

315
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,949
Now, paragraph two,
Mr. and Mrs. Roger Adams,

316
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,917
socially prominent young couple
plan to take a trip around the world.

317
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,316
-The paper's sending you?
- No, I quit the paper.

318
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,109
We're going to have a last fling
before we settle down

319
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,999
and become good old American parents

320
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,000
But, Roger, you just didn't give up
your job on the paper

321
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:55,601
- ...for no reason at all?
- Oh, darling, this trip's an inspiration.

322
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,657
Do you remember the honeymoon
I promised you?

323
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,873
Well we're gonna have it.

324
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,877
But everything's different now.
We've got to think about the baby.

325
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:04,832
That's just it. As soon as the baby comes
we won't be able to go anywhere.

326
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,348
Besides, I want our baby born
in the USA.

327
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,113
Maybe even get to work
and start a little paper.

328
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,147
But a trip like this costs a fortune.

329
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,637
Did you get more than the $20.000?

330
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,675
No, as a matter of fact
we didn't get the $20.000.

331
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:22,473
We sold the property for cash
and got $13.500.

332
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:26,675
Well, can you take a trip, buy a paper
and all like that on $13.500?

333
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,911
Don't forget there's still lawyers' fees,
deductions and stuff like that.

334
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,510
Just how much did you get, Roger?

335
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,948
I'm trying to tell you.
After the deductions we got $10,000.

336
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,627
- Ten thousand?
- Hm-hmm.

337
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:41,308
I still got a couple of thousand
in bills around here to pay.

338
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,953
Then you really got only $8,000.

339
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,638
Yes.

340
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,875
Well, did you ever have
that much money in your life?

341
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,368
No.

342
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,457
Then what are you squawking about?

343
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,597
I'm not squawking.

344
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,157
I just think you're acting like a child.

345
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,390
We should be thinking about the future.

346
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:08,028
You rush in and pack your things
and give up a perfectly good job.

347
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,749
- No grown-up man shouldn't act like that.
- Oh, all right.

348
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:13,593
I thought the trip would be
a lot of fun for you.

349
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,849
If I had known you would feel
like that, I wouldn't have planned on it.

350
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,989
That's all right, let's forget it.
We won't go.

351
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,796
I'll go in and arrange for the packing.

352
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,717
Oh, no, forget about it.

353
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,432
Well, that's all.

354
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,274
Otherwise, you'll enjoy perfect health.

355
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,513
You'll be playing tennis
in a couple of months.

356
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,395
Now I've got some good news for you.

357
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,375
I'm letting your husband
see you today. How's that?

358
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:25,668
Pretty.

359
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,357
Make you feel better?

360
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,171
I've had my hands full
keeping that boy out of here

361
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,172
for the last couple of days.

362
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,833
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Roger.

363
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:57,597
How sweet.

364
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,068
Gee, I've been miserable
not being able to see you, honey.

365
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,395
But I've had a chance
to do some serious thinking, dear.

366
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,390
I've been scouting around
the nearby towns

367
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:44,191
trying to look for that
little newspaper, you know.

368
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,838
No more silly ideas
like travelling around, darling.

369
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,839
You were absolutely right about that.

370
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,956
I think I found it, honey.

371
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:07,430
It's in a little town just north of here,
a place called Rosalia.

372
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,434
- Did you ever hear of it?
- Hm-hmm.

373
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:23,633
It's pretty nearly
the kind of place we wanted.

374
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,971
The fellow who owns the place
has been kind of letting it go to seed, but

375
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:30,672
we can make something of it.

376
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,900
Best of all, darling,
we'll have a home of our own.

377
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,301
Something we'll always call ours.

378
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,912
If I can make a go of the paper,
I'll be able to get you anything you want.

379
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:49,713
I'll be able to get you furniture,
a car, clothes, everything.

380
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,409
You know, it's strange, Roger...

381
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,710
but I can't get myself to care
about those things now.

382
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,011
They don't seem important anymore.

383
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,232
The one thing I've really wanted...

384
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,910
I'm never going to have.

385
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,836
- What do you think of this one, Skeeter?
- Quite an improvement.

386
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:31,270
Gee, Mr. Adams, I'd like to get a job

387
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:33,771
in a live wire outfit like this.

388
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:37,000
You would? All right, Skeetey,
you've got one, and a permanent job, too.

389
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,401
Oh, boy.

390
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,170
- Applejack.
- Howdy!

391
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:07,471
- Hello, fellow!
- How's the old married man?

392
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,710
You had me worried.
Thought you were gonna let me down.

393
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,800
So this is the fastest growing
little newspaper

394
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,601
in the fastest growing little town
in the west.

395
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:16,534
- Certainly!
- And you left the Bulletin for this.

396
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,428
What you got here?

397
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,197
Our new makeup.
What do you think of it?

398
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,191
You printed in code?
No, the linotype machine is stuck.

399
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,795
Why did you think I sent for you?

400
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,198
Applejack!

401
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,873
Miss Julie!

402
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,514
Am I glad to see you.

403
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:39,237
Come on up and help me
fix the bathtub. You're just in time.

404
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,390
Wait a minute.
Let him fix this first.

405
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,955
All right. The newspaper always
comes first around here.

406
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,188
Come on.

407
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,669
What've you been feeding it?

408
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,917
- Is the switch on?
- Yeah.

409
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,155
Now where's that bathtub?

410
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:51,952
Hello, Applejack.

411
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,717
I didn't know you were busy.

412
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:55,355
I'm not busy.

413
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,256
I've just been thinking about
fixing up this old storeroom.

414
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:01,789
I just wanted to show you a new ad
we got from the telephone company.

415
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:05,109
- Well, that helps, doesn't it?
- Sure does.

416
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:08,028
If we keep on with it
we'll pay the paper bill next month.

417
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,432
Is Roger back yet?

418
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,300
No, he's still out
running down subscriptions.

419
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,600
Said he might not be home till late.

420
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:19,778
Well, come on then. Sit down, Applejack.
We might as well have our dinner.

421
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:37,116
Miss Julie, we ought to have
a kid around this house.

422
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,075
I thought you knew about that,
Applejack.

423
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,000
Sure I know about that.
But I'm talking about adopting one.

424
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,512
Sure you can get
some pretty ones that way.

425
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,953
You know, I'm an adopted kid myself.

426
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:59,952
I know that's not much
of a recommendation, but...

427
00:38:59,953 --> 00:39:01,953
it didn't turn out so bad.

428
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:05,396
Besides, I know a lot of regular kids
who wound up in jail.

429
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,295
Miss Julie, I wish you could have seen

430
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:13,006
some of those little sons of guns
I used to room with.

431
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,308
They was the cutest little rascals
you'd ever want to look at.

432
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,511
I don't think Roger would want
a child that way, Applejack.

433
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,031
One that wasn't his own.

434
00:39:24,439 --> 00:39:25,508
Why not?

435
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,597
He's no sucker.
He don't want to gamble.

436
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,037
How do you know what it's gonna be like
if it's gotta be your own?

437
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,398
This way you just walk in
and help yourself to exactly what you want.

438
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,715
There's no guess work.

439
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,954
You know, I thought a lot about that.

440
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:47,837
I want one.

441
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:53,627
Roger was so disappointed when...

442
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,837
I just haven't had the courage to...

443
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:58,473
Miss Julie, do you want
to know something?

444
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,150
He's all for the idea.

445
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,712
Only a few days ago we were working
together and I was talking with him...

446
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,037
- You were talking to him about this?
- Sure.

447
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,112
He's all for it.

448
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,909
Why didn't he say something to me?

449
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,058
He was afraid to say
anything to you...

450
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,859
he was afraid you might have
some fool notions.

451
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:26,717
Silly notions?

452
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:31,174
Why, if he only knew how many...

453
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:36,000
Why, the very idea.

454
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:40,901
My own husband talking about
things like this with the printer.

455
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,001
- Press Manager, please.
- All right, the press manager.

456
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,513
- Are you going to be the mother?
- No, I just thought I...

457
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,031
Fine thing. Wait till I get
my hands on that fellow.

458
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,797
Hello, what's going on?
A fight?

459
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,398
- Hello, Roger.

460
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,828
I want you to take a look at that new ad.
Would you come downstairs...

461
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,436
No, Roger.
Wait a minute. Applejack.

462
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:07,398
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Hm? Tell you what?

463
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,828
What you and Applejack
have been talking about.

464
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,029
Miss Julie, I told you in confidence.

465
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:15,913
What were you talking about?
What did you say to her?

466
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:18,797
- You know, about the...
- He told me.

467
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:22,996
- Told you what?
- You know, what we were talking about...

468
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,031
What were we talking about?

469
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,308
Roger, if you wanted to adopt a baby,
why didn't you talk to me?

470
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:32,670
Yes, you should've told her
in the first place, Roger, not me.

471
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:34,073
I'm not gonna be the mother.

472
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:39,188
Wait a minute. Did you tell Julie
I wanted to adopt a baby?

473
00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:44,275
I hinted at it.
I tried to break it to her gently.

474
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,515
- Oh, you told her!
- Yeah.

475
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:49,109
Roger, I'm so glad
you feel that way.

476
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,147
Yes, she wants it
even more than you, Roger.

477
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,356
Well, if that's the way
we all feel about it.

478
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,798
I like it too

479
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:59,787
- I suppose it's settled.
- Oh, Roger, I'm so glad.

480
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,054
If it hadn't been for Applejack
letting it slip out

481
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,855
I don't suppose
I ever would have known.

482
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:06,275
Guess I'd better go fix that press.

483
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,789
Yeah, you fix everything up,
don't you?

484
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:11,149
Didn't do so bad with the bathtub.

485
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,169
Julie, one other thing...
Look, er...

486
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:19,251
When you get to this place,
don't get enthusiastic right off the bat.

487
00:42:19,779 --> 00:42:23,818
You know, don't just rush in and grab
the first kid you see and go nuts about it.

488
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:28,097
What makes you think I'll grab
the first one they show me?

489
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,257
I've been doing the shopping
in this family for some time now...

490
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,689
I just don't bring home anything.

491
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,695
You came home with this tie,
didn't you?

492
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:40,056
It's nice.
Everybody's wearing bow ties.

493
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:43,457
I have your letter here.

494
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:46,655
Two-year-old child, blue eyes...

495
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,293
curly hair, dimpled chin,
sweet disposition...

496
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,212
We'd prefer a boy.

497
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:53,335
But we'd like to look at the girl, too.

498
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:55,415
Julie, you know we agreed on a boy.

499
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,257
But it won't hurt to look, will it?

500
00:42:57,379 --> 00:42:59,290
All right, we'll look.

501
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,615
Now, what can you show us?

502
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,815
This is the Administration Building.
We don't have any children here at all.

503
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,999
Oh.

504
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:12,317
Everybody wants blue eyes,
curly hair, dimple... sweet...

505
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:15,518
Everybody wants a two-year-old child.
Will you tell me why?

506
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, you see, in our case,

507
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:23,201
that would have been the age
of our own child, if...

508
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:26,602
Oh, I see.

509
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:29,772
Anyway, when they're two years old,

510
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,773
they're more or less
house-broken then, aren't they?

511
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:34,458
Not always.

512
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:43,571
At the moment we haven't
any children available at all.

513
00:43:43,699 --> 00:43:45,483
There's a long waiting list,

514
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,784
there are three applications for every child.

515
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:50,213
If you get one within a year,
you'll be lucky.

516
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,714
- What?
- A year?

517
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,412
You mean to say
we might have to wait a year?

518
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:57,751
Well, after all, real parents
wait almost a year.

519
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:02,455
- Yes, certainly...
- You see, we've waited so long already.

520
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:05,173
I know, my dear.
But you're both very young.

521
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:08,696
Then, too, we have to have time
to make our investigation.

522
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:10,778
Investigation?

523
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:14,212
Yes, you see. we're just as particular
about you as prospective parents

524
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:16,513
as you are about the child.

525
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:18,737
Naturally.

526
00:44:19,019 --> 00:44:21,294
What is your business, Mr. Adams?

527
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:25,052
I'm a publisher.
I run the Rosalia Courier.

528
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,897
- Publisher?
- Sure.

529
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:31,892
I beg your pardon.
Mrs. Green is on the phone.

530
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:33,493
What shall I tell her?

531
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,894
Oh..

532
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:37,895
Tell her that we're sorry.

533
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:40,396
But according to our investigator's report

534
00:44:40,397 --> 00:44:43,469
we find that Mr. Green
doesn't have a steady income.

535
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:46,854
Later perhaps, if he finds himself
better situated, we'll...

536
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,970
reconsider their application.

537
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:54,509
You see, it's not our aim to place
our children in homes of wealth...

538
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:57,608
but it's absolutely necessary for us
to have the assurance

539
00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:00,800
that the adoptive parents
are financially responsible.

540
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:01,801
Oh, sure.

541
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,609
I see in your letter
that you live in the country.

542
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,611
Good. I presume that means then
that you have a house and yard.

543
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:13,895
- Well...
- No, we don't have a yard.

544
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:18,449
We live in an apartment.
But there's a nice park nearby.

545
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:22,074
We've got a swell roof too.
We've been putting a fence around it.

546
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:24,705
And I could build a slide and a sandbox.

547
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,458
As a matter of fact,
a roof is better for a kid

548
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,359
because then he can't get on the street, see?

549
00:45:30,419 --> 00:45:32,569
Look, it doesn't have
to be a yard, does it?

550
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,248
No, but you have a separate room
for the child, haven't you?

551
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:37,653
That's very important.

552
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,818
Oh, yes, we have a lovely room.
It's practically fixed up now.

553
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,731
Oh, well that's fine.

554
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:47,138
Now, about income.

555
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,171
Approximately, how much
do you make a week?

556
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,417
Well, I couldn't tell you offhand.

557
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:59,656
I imagine about $100 a week.
Of course, I'd have to look at the books.

558
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:01,212
Well, that's excellent.

559
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:03,670
If you'll just take that application
home with you,

560
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:07,271
fill it out and mail it in to us
so we'll have all the details.

561
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:10,094
Then in due time, one of our investigators
will call on you.

562
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,095
Fine.

563
00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:14,292
You'll call us before she comes,
won't you?

564
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:18,213
No, we just drop in.
That's our policy.

565
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:22,134
You see, we want to find your house
as it is everyday...

566
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:25,536
- ...not when it's fixed up for company.
- I see.

567
00:46:25,437 --> 00:46:28,098
- Good bye.
- Good bye, Miss Oliver.

568
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,255
Oh... it doesn't matter
if he hasn't got curly hair.

569
00:46:34,256 --> 00:46:36,156
It doesn't really matter.

570
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,750
- They're darn choosy, if you ask me.
- Why do you have to be a big shot?

571
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:49,359
- When?
- You know we don't make $100 a week.

572
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,252
You want the baby, don't you?

573
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:53,649
They can't prove it.
We don't keep books.

574
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:01,617
Hey, quit stalling.
Get on with the cleaning.

575
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:03,172
Look, honey, left from the earthquake.

576
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:05,654
From Japan?
You'd better buy some more.

577
00:47:26,999 --> 00:47:29,957
Excuse me, lady.
You should give a fellow a warning.

578
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:32,592
Does Mrs. Adams live here?

579
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,675
Yes, upstairs. I'll call her.

580
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:38,553
Don't bother. I'm Miss Oliver
from the orphanage. I'll find her.

581
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,354
I don't think she's home just now.
I think she's in church.

582
00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:44,549
In church?
This time of day?

583
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,628
Well, you see, she and Mr. Adams
go there quite a lot.

584
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,593
They just go there and sit.
Fine people, mam.

585
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:06,117
Well, I'm sure she won't mind
if I just look around a bit.

586
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:10,068
No, she won't mind.

587
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,874
-How do you do, Miss Oliver?
- How do you do, Mrs. Adams?

588
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,509
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

589
00:49:06,399 --> 00:49:08,276
Won't you sit down?

590
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:14,077
- Here.
- No, thank you.

591
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,236
- You've come to see the apartment?
- That's right.

592
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:28,114
This is it. It's not very neat
at the moment. We're cleaning.

593
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:29,908
I see.

594
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,230
That's our little breakfast room out there.

595
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:39,999
And uh...

596
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,313
if you'll step right this way...

597
00:49:48,039 --> 00:49:49,518
This is our kitchen.

598
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:58,633
My husband has been meaning
to fix this door for some time, it's...

599
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:01,004
he's been so busy...

600
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:11,598
And that brings us back
to the breakfast room.

601
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,591
- Can I fix you a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

602
00:50:21,759 --> 00:50:25,229
You spoke of a child's room.
A lovely room.

603
00:50:25,799 --> 00:50:28,233
Yes, that's over here.

604
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,797
- Well, this is sweet.
- You really like it?

605
00:50:49,919 --> 00:50:53,229
Any child would be lucky
to have a room like this.

606
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,388
Well, I want you to see our yard.
We're fixing that up too.

607
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:02,708
Well...

608
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,716
Hello, Miss Oliver.
Didn't expect you.

609
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:08,878
I just finished making it.

610
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,031
I thought I'd try it out see if it was
strong enough for that two-year old.

611
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,753
I think I have a surprise for you.

612
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:17,630
A baby came in yesterday.

613
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,351
- No!
- Miss Oliver, you mean...

614
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,151
- Here, come and sit down.
- Thank you.

615
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,588
Sit down.

616
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:29,348
That's the reason we came around
to see you sooner than we expected.

617
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:30,878
It's a little girl..

618
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,032
We don't want a girl.

619
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,228
Five weeks and three days old.

620
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:40,238
Five weeks!

621
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:45,872
Well, we did speak
of an older child, you know.

622
00:51:46,279 --> 00:51:48,918
You might have to wait a long time.

623
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:53,515
After all, aren't you making to great
a point of a child's age, Mr. Adams?

624
00:51:53,799 --> 00:51:56,791
Eventually this child
will be two years old.

625
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:00,508
But we don't know anything
about little babies.

626
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:03,468
No one does until they have them.

627
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,512
And this is such an unusual little baby.

628
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,294
Actually there's another couple
who has first choice...

629
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:11,895
and that's strictly off the record.

630
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:15,275
But somehow I feel she's exactly
the child for you.

631
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:17,510
That's why I wanted you to see her first

632
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,595
and I couldn't resist giving you the chance.

633
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:22,528
- Did you bring her with you
- No, she's in the nursery.

634
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:24,908
You and Mr. Adams will have to come
over to the city to see her.

635
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:28,197
What's she like, Miss Oliver?

636
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:33,993
Well, I can't describe her exactly,
but she's...

637
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:38,031
well, she's like no other child.

638
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,433
Like no other child.

639
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:44,711
But she isn't a boy.

640
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,273
But look, Roger,
there's no harm in looking at her.

641
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:52,470
If you don't like her,
I won't say a word.

642
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:54,078
What's the use? We don't want her.

643
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:02,148
Please, darling.
It won't hurt to look at her.

644
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,596
Well, all right, we'll look.

645
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,812
That's fine. You call me up and I'll make
an appointment at the nursery.

646
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,413
I must go now.

647
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:20,468
If you change your mind,
you will call me up, won't you?

648
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:23,687
Yes, yes.

649
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:29,197
Miss Oliver, please don't show her to that
other couple until we've seen her, will you?

650
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:31,356
I won't, my dear.

651
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:22,494
She's like no other child.

652
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:25,192
That's why I wanted you
to see her first.

653
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:28,193
Like no other child.

654
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,848
Well, how about him?

655
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:47,016
This is a day nursery.
All these youngsters have parents.

656
00:54:47,419 --> 00:54:50,338
All except this lovely little girl.

657
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,451
What a grip...

658
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,738
For a girl, I mean.

659
00:55:08,879 --> 00:55:10,897
Would you like to hold her?

660
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,011
May I.

661
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,337
How are you, kid?

662
00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:58,729
Well, you've had your look, dear.
How about going back home?

663
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,772
All right, she's yours, I guess.

664
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:11,933
- When do we get her?
- Now, if you like.

665
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:14,819
She's yours on a year's probation.

666
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:15,928
Now?

667
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:19,093
You mean we can just walk out
of here with her like this?

668
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:21,336
It sometimes happens that way...

669
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:27,015
if we make sure that the parents
and the baby are just right for each other.

670
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:30,493
We have no clothes for her.
We don't know how to feed her.

671
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,416
It's such a little baby.

672
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,858
Miss Morgan will take care of everything.

673
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,616
She'll give you the formulas and so forth...

674
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:39,573
then you can go downtown
and buy whatever is necessary.

675
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,655
Thank you, Miss Oliver,
for being so kind.

676
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,532
Don't thank me.
It just happened so.

677
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,017
Perhaps before you make up
your minds fully to take the child...

678
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:58,333
you'd like to have me go
into her history.

679
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,133
I assure you it's an excellent one.

680
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,327
If she'll take a chance on us,
we'll take a chance on her.

681
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:08,413
- Good bye.
- Good bye, Miss. Oliver.

682
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:19,437
I'll shut the door.

683
00:57:31,639 --> 00:57:34,278
I she wakes up again,
you know what that means.

684
00:57:38,399 --> 00:57:40,900
Wait a minute. Wait with that baby
till I turn on the light.

685
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:43,301
I don't want you to drop him...
I mean her.

686
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:08,877
Take off your shoes.

687
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:57,998
Go get the big one in our room.

688
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:17,956
Come on... let me have it

689
01:00:25,479 --> 01:00:28,149
It's all right with her.
Come on, let's go to bed.

690
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:30,828
No.

691
01:00:45,999 --> 01:00:47,796
I don't think I'll go to bed.

692
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:49,870
She eats again in a half hour.

693
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:52,510
The directions say so.

694
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,910
Set the alarm.
Come on.

695
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,716
Turn the bed clothes down, will you?

696
01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:13,871
Turn it off!

697
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,152
Turn it off!

698
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,118
Press it!

699
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:33,754
Please.

700
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,112
What's the matter with it?

701
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,811
I don't know.
Do you think she's all right?

702
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:13,812
Huh?

703
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:23,072
Is it breathing?

704
01:02:32,279 --> 01:02:34,239
She's certainly a cute a little baby,
isn't she?

705
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:36,970
We were lucky to get her.

706
01:02:42,399 --> 01:02:43,512
Let's go to bed.

707
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:40,212
Well, do something, quickly!

708
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,092
What do I do?

709
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,689
Do something. Can't you see
the baby's suffering?

710
01:03:51,499 --> 01:03:53,376
That's just it.
I don't know what to do.

711
01:03:58,299 --> 01:04:00,938
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

712
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:03,607
Here. You take her.
Hm?

713
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:07,137
Go on. You do something.

714
01:04:16,299 --> 01:04:18,418
Oh, no... I'm going to get Miss Oliver.

715
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:49,958
Just wanted her daddy.

716
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,537
Pull the chair, please.

717
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,292
Julie! The baby!
It's gone!

718
01:07:37,299 --> 01:07:38,971
The baby's kidnapped!

719
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,607
She was lonesome
so I brought her in here with us.

720
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:04,013
Don't ever do that to me again!

721
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,414
Good morning, boys.

722
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,475
What are you trying to do?
Shut it off!

723
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:44,500
- What are you trying to do?
- What am I trying to do?

724
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:47,273
I'm trying to get your crummy paper out,
that's what I'm trying to do.

725
01:08:47,274 --> 01:08:48,997
What's the idea of waking
the baby up?

726
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,911
- What baby?
- My baby.

727
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,509
- Your baby?
- Yeah, it came last night.

728
01:08:54,639 --> 01:08:56,118
No fooling, a baby?

729
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,528
- A baby, a baby!
- Quiet, quiet!

730
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,832
Come on, I'll show you.

731
01:09:41,699 --> 01:09:44,338
- Can I help?
- No.

732
01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:15,531
- Sure you don't want me to help?
- No, thanks.

733
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:45,417
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

734
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,152
What's the trouble?

735
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,432
I can't do anything as long as
you're sitting here watching me.

736
01:12:04,559 --> 01:12:06,929
Get out! Go on,
get out all of you!

737
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:08,631
What do you think this is?

738
01:12:08,599 --> 01:12:12,175
Go on, get down to that paper.
And be quiet about it.

739
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:17,272
Oh, Roger, I'm afraid I'll drown it.

740
01:12:17,479 --> 01:12:20,239
Oh, now, darling, take it easy.

741
01:12:20,359 --> 01:12:23,595
I could drown in that much water.
Here.

742
01:12:39,839 --> 01:12:41,397
Now, little peanut...

743
01:12:45,559 --> 01:12:48,676
your Uncle Applejack's gonna
give you a nice bath.

744
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:56,515
Give me that wash rag.
There we are.

745
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:07,999
I'll never be able to do that.
We'll have to give her back.

746
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,800
Sure you will, darling.

747
01:13:09,999 --> 01:13:13,769
All you gotta do is decide
who's boss and throw her in.

748
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:17,214
How in the world did you ever
learn to do that, Applejack?

749
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:18,995
My sister had four kids.

750
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:21,110
She'd take two and I'd take two.

751
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,072
Where's that towel?

752
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:44,508
There we are.

753
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:55,651
- Where's the talcum?
- Hm? Here.

754
01:14:13,452 --> 01:14:14,852
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

755
01:14:16,353 --> 01:14:17,753
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

756
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:20,515
- Where is it?
- What?

757
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:22,858
- It.
- Oh, here...

758
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,971
- There we are.

759
01:14:27,299 --> 01:14:29,714
You sure is my fine girl.

760
01:14:38,799 --> 01:14:40,391
Just a minute, now..

761
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:50,272
Think you can hold this a minute
without dropping it?

762
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:58,356
Here, give it here.

763
01:14:58,519 --> 01:15:00,191
I forget whether...

764
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:03,554
Now watch this closely.

765
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:15,549
I'm a one-pin man myself.

766
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,590
There we are.
Let's see you jump out of there, peanut.

767
01:15:27,919 --> 01:15:29,716
Here you go to your mama.

768
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:37,669
Better write all that down,
cause I might get a better offer.

769
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:07,589
# Just Molly and me,
and baby makes three. #

770
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,948
# We're happy in my blue heaven. #

771
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:16,151
- She hasn't got your smile, Roger.
- Oh, sure, she's good-looking.

772
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:20,515
- Still sorry she wasn't a boy?
- Hm?

773
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:22,592
A boy.
What do you mean a boy?

774
01:16:22,759 --> 01:16:25,834
Did you hear that? You wanted a boy.
I didn't want no boy.

775
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:28,674
Trina's Daddy's little girl,
aren't you, Trina?

776
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:43,429
Roger, be careful now.

777
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,508
Hello!

778
01:17:00,759 --> 01:17:02,671
- Hello, Miss Oliver.
- How do you do, Mrs. Adams.

779
01:17:02,672 --> 01:17:03,772
Come in.

780
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,437
Thank you so much for letting us know
you were coming this time.

781
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,875
- Hello, Miss Oliver.
- Oh, hello, Mr. Adams.

782
01:17:12,999 --> 01:17:15,718
Trina, this is your fairy godmother,
Miss Oliver.

783
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:20,995
Hello, sweetheart.
Yes, she's not very timid, is she?

784
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:25,430
I can plainly see that she
adores her father.

785
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:27,876
She means everything to us.

786
01:17:27,877 --> 01:17:29,377
What's the matter, got a cold?

787
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:32,197
Yes, you do. Everything.

788
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:33,997
When are we going to own her outright?

789
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:37,395
- You go before the judge the 27th.
- 27th, eh?

790
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:41,075
- You'll want to see these charts.
- Yes.

791
01:17:47,559 --> 01:17:49,595
One you can send back to us.

792
01:17:50,839 --> 01:17:55,310
And the other you'll file with the court,
at the court with the final papers.

793
01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:00,071
These are the same questions
that you answered last year.

794
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:01,791
I just want to bring them up to date.

795
01:18:03,492 --> 01:18:05,192
Now let's see.

796
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:06,438
Religion?

797
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,032
Same.

798
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,592
Age?

799
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:23,952
- One year older.
- I have that.

800
01:18:25,559 --> 01:18:27,038
Profession?

801
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:29,291
Still publisher, isn't it?

802
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,308
Yes.

803
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:36,511
Income?

804
01:18:40,519 --> 01:18:42,032
Income?

805
01:18:43,879 --> 01:18:45,631
Well, you see, Miss Oliver...

806
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:47,428
None.

807
01:19:15,219 --> 01:19:18,033
Oh, that's the way it is
in the newspaper game, Miss Oliver.

808
01:19:18,059 --> 01:19:19,909
Specially when you're starting
one of your own.

809
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,553
You have to close down once
before you really get going.

810
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:27,935
Oh, it's only temporary. I'm having a jam
with my wholesale paper mill.

811
01:19:28,059 --> 01:19:31,000
First thing you know
I'll have it humming by the 27th.

812
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:34,250
It's only closed for a while.

813
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm sure you'll find a way,
Mr. Adams.

814
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:46,100
But you and I have to prove
to the judge

815
01:19:46,101 --> 01:19:49,200
that your income is enough
to take care of Trina.

816
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,538
You know we gave everything
Trina needed.

817
01:19:53,659 --> 01:19:55,589
no matter who else had to suffer
around here.

818
01:19:56,519 --> 01:19:58,389
I realize that.

819
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:10,235
Well, I must go now.
That's all we can do today.

820
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:13,847
Could I drive you to the train?

821
01:20:13,979 --> 01:20:16,354
No, thank you.
I really like to walk.

822
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:21,598
This country air is so fresh.
Good bye.

823
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:33,295
The battle axe.
She doesn't want us to have Trina.

824
01:20:33,619 --> 01:20:35,071
Yes, she does, darling.

825
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:40,512
Oh yes, she does.

826
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:04,184
Better prepare your facts.

827
01:23:04,185 --> 01:23:06,785
- The option receipt. The Adams case.
- What?

828
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:08,126
The Adams case.

829
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,227
Oh, yes, yes.

830
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:14,202
And if either one or both
of you gentlemen conduct yourselves

831
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:17,479
like you've been doing today
I'll hold you in contempt, the both of you.

832
01:23:29,428 --> 01:23:31,988
Oh, this is the child in question.

833
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,189
Yes, I see, hm...

834
01:23:47,248 --> 01:23:50,702
Looking over these adoption papers here

835
01:23:50,703 --> 01:23:53,503
I see that you have no income
at present. 

836
01:23:54,588 --> 01:23:56,000
Is that correct?

837
01:23:56,148 --> 01:23:57,447
Yes, Your Honor.

838
01:23:57,668 --> 01:23:59,104
What is this, Miss Oliver?

839
01:23:59,105 --> 01:24:01,705
You know this case
should never have come before me.

840
01:24:02,308 --> 01:24:05,978
Well, Your Honor,
I feel that this is a special case.

841
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:08,403
I kept hoping until the last minute...

842
01:24:08,428 --> 01:24:11,200
that Mr. Adams might be able
to resume the run of his paper

843
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:12,901
 or get a job.

844
01:24:12,902 --> 01:24:17,185
But unfortunately he hasn't been able
to do either, so I thought...

845
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:20,605
Under these conditions
I can't grant the adoption.

846
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,006
This child will have to revert
to the orphanage.

847
01:24:25,568 --> 01:24:27,703
Will you draw up a chair, please,

848
01:24:27,704 --> 01:24:31,904
while I prepare these
release papers for you to sign?

849
01:24:39,868 --> 01:24:41,779
It's just a matter of routine.

850
01:24:56,748 --> 01:24:57,736
If you please, Your Honor...

851
01:24:58,537 --> 01:25:00,100
it can't just be a matter of routine

852
01:25:00,101 --> 01:25:02,200
for people to have their baby
taken away from them.

853
01:25:03,148 --> 01:25:05,457
This child is ours, Judge.

854
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,600
But those are the requirements of the law.

855
01:25:09,748 --> 01:25:13,297
Yes, but you see, we've had her
since she was 6 weeks old.

856
01:25:13,428 --> 01:25:14,516
It just doesn't seem reasonable

857
01:25:14,517 --> 01:25:17,400
 that we should have to give her
back now to strangers.

858
01:25:17,508 --> 01:25:20,625
Mr. Adams, you are not here
to plead your case.

859
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:25,984
You've had the regular opportunity
to prove your fitness to provide.

860
01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:31,140
We are fit, Judge,
if you just look at the record.

861
01:25:32,228 --> 01:25:34,947
Without any income I have no alternative.

862
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,297
Didn't you make that clear, Miss Oliver?

863
01:25:39,428 --> 01:25:41,464
Yes, Your Honor, I did.
But I thought...

864
01:25:41,588 --> 01:25:43,897
I'm sorry, but that is the law.

865
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,667
Look, Your Honor, she's not like
an automobile, or an icebox

866
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:05,597
or a piece of furniture or something
you buy on time...

867
01:26:05,598 --> 01:26:08,342
and then when you can't keep up
the payments they take it away from you.

868
01:26:09,548 --> 01:26:11,379
Now sit still and be a good girl.

869
01:26:11,948 --> 01:26:14,098
Anyone could give up
those kinds of things.

870
01:26:14,428 --> 01:26:16,862
But I ask you, Judge,
how can you give up your own child?

871
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:20,226
She is our child just as much
as if she'd been born to us.

872
01:26:21,948 --> 01:26:24,018
No, Daddy isn't going to go away, dear.

873
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:31,944
Look, judge, we've had her
over a year now.

874
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:35,425
Why, we walked the floor with her
when she had the colic.

875
01:26:35,828 --> 01:26:38,626
We've lost nights of sleep worrying
every time she had got a tooth.

876
01:26:38,788 --> 01:26:40,134
We've gone through everything.

877
01:26:40,135 --> 01:26:42,435
Everything that real parents have
with one of their own.

878
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,621
Ask Miss Oliver here about the inspections
we've had to have.

879
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:48,748
Her weight charts,
her vaccination certificates...

880
01:26:48,868 --> 01:26:51,223
her toys, her dresses, her toothbrush.

881
01:26:51,388 --> 01:26:53,553
They come around regularly
and check up on all those things

882
01:26:53,554 --> 01:26:55,400
to see if we're taking care
of her properly.

883
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:59,303
How many real parents can keep one
of their own and go through that?

884
01:27:00,628 --> 01:27:02,565
And you sit there
and say it's a matter of routine 

885
01:27:02,566 --> 01:27:03,867
for you to take her away from us.

886
01:27:03,868 --> 01:27:06,541
Please, Mr. Adams.

887
01:27:10,268 --> 01:27:11,986
I'm sorry, Judge.

888
01:27:16,287 --> 01:27:17,387
But...

889
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:22,307
Well, you see, we weren't
as fortunate as most people.

890
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26,119
We would have had
one of our own, only...

891
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:30,260
You don't know how badly
my wife wanted a child.

892
01:27:31,148 --> 01:27:33,500
It wasn't so important to me, I...

893
01:27:33,468 --> 01:27:35,338
I don't know, I suppose most men
are like this.

894
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:37,439
Children never meant a great deal to me.

895
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:39,777
I like them, all right, I suppose, but...

896
01:27:40,788 --> 01:27:43,200
Well, what I'm trying to say is,
Your Honor...

897
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:45,480
the first time I saw her...

898
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:49,878
she looked so little and helpless...

899
01:27:50,388 --> 01:27:53,741
I didn't know babies were so little.

900
01:27:55,588 --> 01:27:58,161
And then when she took hold of
my finger and held on to it, she...

901
01:27:58,162 --> 01:27:59,900
she just sort of walked
into my heart, Judge,

902
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:01,500
and she was there to stay.

903
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:04,419
I didn't know I could feel like that

904
01:28:06,188 --> 01:28:10,420
I had always been kind of
careless and irresponsible.

905
01:28:10,908 --> 01:28:13,024
I wanted to be a bigshot.

906
01:28:14,068 --> 01:28:17,026
I couldn't work for anybody, I had to be
my own boss, that sort of thing.

907
01:28:21,628 --> 01:28:23,423
Now here I am standing
in front of a judge...

908
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,550
pleading for just a little longer
so that I can prove to you...

909
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:28,324
I can support a little child
that doesn't weigh quite 20 lbs.

910
01:28:34,908 --> 01:28:37,641
It's not only for my wife and me
I'm asking you to let us keep her, Judge,

911
01:28:37,642 --> 01:28:39,221
it's for her sake too.

912
01:28:40,428 --> 01:28:42,174
She doesn't know any parents but us.

913
01:28:42,175 --> 01:28:44,075
She wouldn't know
what had happened to her.

914
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:47,100
You see, there are so many
little things about her...

915
01:28:47,101 --> 01:28:49,801
nobody would understand her
the way Julie and I do.

916
01:28:50,548 --> 01:28:52,585
We love her, Judge.

917
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:55,086
Please don't take her away from us.

918
01:28:57,308 --> 01:28:59,499
I'm not a bigshot now, I....

919
01:28:59,428 --> 01:29:01,988
I'll do anything.
I'll work for anybody.

920
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:05,223
I'll beg, I'll borrow, I'll....

921
01:29:06,348 --> 01:29:10,307
Please, Judge, I'll sell anything I've got
until I get going again.

922
01:29:10,828 --> 01:29:13,217
She'll never go hungry,
she'll never be without clothes...

923
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,464
not as long as I've got
two good hands to help me.

924
01:30:36,948 --> 01:30:39,400
- She's yours, dear.
- Ours!

925
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,363
Now and forever.

926
01:30:46,288 --> 01:30:48,297
Oh, Trina!

927
01:30:50,268 --> 01:30:53,828
Nothing can ever take her
from us now.

928
01:31:21,688 --> 01:31:25,367
You better hurry up, Daddy.
Mommie'll be home any minute now.

929
01:31:25,388 --> 01:31:28,422
Yeah. You go and watch for her.
Let me know when she comes, hm?

930
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,883
- How are you getting along, Applejack?
- Ain't she a beauty?

931
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:43,209
- Here she comes.
- Now? Well, let's get the presents, quick.

932
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:47,618
Here she comes.
We'll get them later.

933
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,714
Where is everybody?

934
01:32:11,715 --> 01:32:12,715
Quick!

935
01:32:14,164 --> 01:32:15,359
Trina?

936
01:32:17,967 --> 01:32:19,117
Trina?

937
01:32:19,728 --> 01:32:22,400
Where can everybody be
this time of the day?

938
01:32:22,401 --> 01:32:23,685
Surprise!

939
01:32:23,812 --> 01:32:25,885
Surprise!
Happy birthday!

940
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,300
Happy birthday, darling.

941
01:32:28,296 --> 01:32:30,900
- Oh, thank you.
- Sit down. Let's see the presents.

942
01:32:30,901 --> 01:32:33,239
I had almost forgotten today
was my birthday.

943
01:32:33,921 --> 01:32:37,121
- This is from Daddy.
- Daddy?

944
01:32:41,928 --> 01:32:45,924
Why, Roger,
I always wanted one like that.

945
01:32:50,175 --> 01:32:51,928
- Look Applejack.
- I'm glad you like it, darling.

946
01:32:53,137 --> 01:32:55,779
And this is from Uncle Applejack.

947
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:57,900
From Applejack?

948
01:32:58,822 --> 01:33:01,976
Oh, I think I can guess what this is.

949
01:33:02,906 --> 01:33:04,499
Handkerchief.

950
01:33:05,308 --> 01:33:07,585
Oh, it's beautiful, Applejack.

951
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:11,667
I always figured a person can't have
too many handkerchiefs.

952
01:33:11,914 --> 01:33:13,234
Thank you.

953
01:33:15,797 --> 01:33:18,472
- And this is from me.
- From you?

954
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:24,154
I can't imagine what this is.

955
01:33:24,155 --> 01:33:25,955
What on earth can...

956
01:33:27,247 --> 01:33:30,720
I got you a record,
as you love records.

957
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:34,569
And 'cause you and Daddy
love each other so much.

958
01:33:35,454 --> 01:33:39,770
Oh, Trina, that's sweet, darling.
Thank you.

959
01:33:39,898 --> 01:33:42,016
- Come on, let's play it see how it goes.
- Come on, Trina.

960
01:33:45,283 --> 01:33:48,060
Dinner's ready. Come and get it
or I'll throw it in the crate

961
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,724
Oh, this is wonderful!

962
01:33:50,848 --> 01:33:53,527
Dinner in my own home
and I didn't have to cook it.

963
01:33:58,028 --> 01:33:59,228
Well.

964
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:19,321
We sure changed the complexion
of that bird.

965
01:34:19,352 --> 01:34:20,807
We certainly did.

966
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:24,007
What did you do
in school today, darling?

967
01:34:24,337 --> 01:34:28,471
Oh, I almost forgot. I was choosed.
I'm going to be in the Christmas play.

968
01:34:31,543 --> 01:34:32,977
In the Christmas play.

969
01:34:33,304 --> 01:34:34,659
What are you going to do?

970
01:34:34,906 --> 01:34:36,944
I'm going to sing in the carol.

971
01:34:37,849 --> 01:34:39,761
Why, Trina, that's wonderful.

972
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:42,466
It'll be fun making you a carol's costume.

973
01:34:42,493 --> 01:34:45,614
I don't need any costume.
Nobody sees me.

974
01:34:45,695 --> 01:34:47,376
Nobody sees you?

975
01:34:47,377 --> 01:34:50,457
All I have to wear is a clean dress
and some sneakers.

976
01:34:50,619 --> 01:34:51,689
I'm the echo.

977
01:34:52,461 --> 01:34:57,300
I'm a way off behind the scene.
You only hear my voice.

978
01:34:57,446 --> 01:35:02,976
Miss Hopkins says it gives
a faraway sound like angels in heaven.

979
01:35:03,391 --> 01:35:05,484
Well, why do you have
to wear the sneakers?

980
01:35:05,713 --> 01:35:07,849
The sneakers are so I'll be quiet.

981
01:35:07,975 --> 01:35:12,555
I have to walk up in the sky behind
a cloud and take a big star with me.

982
01:35:12,779 --> 01:35:15,117
Then, when I get over the manger,
I stop.

983
01:35:15,281 --> 01:35:17,079
And then the angels sing.

984
01:35:17,203 --> 01:35:20,083
And when my turn comes,
I sing the echo.

985
01:35:20,084 --> 01:35:23,884
Then I sneak off quietly.
And next year, when I'm big...

986
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:28,526
I get to be an angel
and wear an angel suit.

987
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,813
I'll get seen then.

988
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:36,128
Of course you'll get seen then,
darling.

989
01:35:36,419 --> 01:35:40,132
Is it a long time
until next year, Daddy?

990
01:35:40,263 --> 01:35:42,825
Oh, no, darling.
It'll be here in no time at all.

991
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,900
Oh, I forgot.

992
01:35:58,259 --> 01:36:00,671
Oh my, what happened to the lights?
Shh!

993
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,679
Did you see the lights go out?

994
01:36:03,063 --> 01:36:10,441
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

995
01:36:10,569 --> 01:36:16,449
Happy birthday, dear Mommy,
happy birthday to you.

996
01:36:22,841 --> 01:36:26,000
- Hurry up, Mommy.
- I'll park the car.

997
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:28,663
All right. See you out front.
Come on, dear.

998
01:40:03,011 --> 01:40:05,000
I spoiled everything.

999
01:40:05,001 --> 01:40:09,574
Now Miss Hopkins won't let me
be an angel next year.

1000
01:40:09,697 --> 01:40:12,433
- Yes, she will, darling.
- Certainly.

1001
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:15,797
I was talking to her.
She said you did fine.

1002
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:18,801
Why, you were better than
the rest of them put together.

1003
01:40:18,802 --> 01:40:19,802
See?

1004
01:40:20,087 --> 01:40:23,398
- Honest?
- Honest.

1005
01:40:28,053 --> 01:40:32,365
Gee, I don't know what people
would do without Christmas.

1006
01:40:32,837 --> 01:40:35,798
I don't know what we'd do
without you, honey.

1007
01:44:13,049 --> 01:44:15,890
Would you please stop that door
from banging?

1008
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,700
I wish you wouldn't go out.

1009
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,702
I've got to get out of here
and get some fresh air.

1010
01:45:00,009 --> 01:45:02,479
Isn't that someone downstairs?

1011
01:45:07,912 --> 01:45:09,486
There's someone at the front door.

1012
01:45:27,485 --> 01:45:29,241
May I use your phone, please?

1013
01:45:29,242 --> 01:45:31,543
Our car is stalled
and I'd like to call a taxi.

1014
01:45:31,544 --> 01:45:34,100
It's right here on the balcony.
If you'll just walk around that way.

1015
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:35,101
Thank you.

1016
01:45:37,103 --> 01:45:39,826
I saw your light burning
and we're in such a hurry.

1017
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:56,454
Cabs are always busy
on a night like this.

1018
01:46:01,103 --> 01:46:02,904
I do hope we can get one.

1019
01:46:03,027 --> 01:46:05,226
Tommy's in the Christmas play.

1020
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:12,639
I hope we don't get late, Mommy.

1021
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:20,767
Out car is right out in front.
I'll drive you over, if you like.

1022
01:46:21,219 --> 01:46:24,500
Oh, that's very kind of you.
But it wouldn't be too much trouble?

1023
01:46:24,501 --> 01:46:25,984
Not too much trouble.

1024
01:46:26,885 --> 01:46:28,000
Come, dear.

1025
01:46:30,915 --> 01:46:33,335
You can't start the car.
The battery's dead.

1026
01:46:33,336 --> 01:46:34,834
I'll have to crank it.

1027
01:46:58,584 --> 01:47:00,738
I do hope we're not late, Mama.

1028
01:47:12,528 --> 01:47:14,588
I can't thank you enough.

1029
01:47:14,589 --> 01:47:17,930
If you only knew what these things
mean to a child.

1030
01:47:21,082 --> 01:47:22,578
Let's get out of here.

1031
01:47:35,268 --> 01:47:36,423
Roger!

1032
01:47:52,036 --> 01:47:53,392
What's the matter?

1033
01:48:01,233 --> 01:48:03,000
Take the car on home.

1034
01:48:06,141 --> 01:48:09,008
- Roger!
- I'm not coming home.

1035
01:48:09,547 --> 01:48:12,667
I don't ever want to see anything
or anyone that reminds me.

1036
01:48:15,518 --> 01:48:17,153
All right.

1037
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:19,813
Good bye.

1038
01:48:30,862 --> 01:48:36,522
# We strolled the lane together #

1039
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:42,523
# laughed at the rain together. #

1040
01:48:43,244 --> 01:48:48,774
# Sang love's refrain together #

1041
01:48:49,635 --> 01:48:56,883
# We'll always be together. #

1042
01:49:23,593 --> 01:49:29,859
# You were meant for me #

1043
01:49:29,860 --> 01:49:38,260
# I was meant for you. #

1044
01:49:39,501 --> 01:49:46,669
# Nature patterned you
and when she was done... #

1045
01:49:46,670 --> 01:49:49,970
# you were... #
- Here's your tickets.

1046
01:49:53,326 --> 01:49:56,024
Those cool songs kind of
take you back, don't they?

1047
01:49:58,054 --> 01:50:00,073
Yes, they do take you back.

1048
01:50:02,341 --> 01:50:04,561
Did you decide which ones
you're gonna keep

1049
01:50:04,562 --> 01:50:06,402
and which ones you're gonna
leave for him?

1050
01:50:08,191 --> 01:50:09,712
Funny, Applejack.

1051
01:50:11,196 --> 01:50:13,377
I can't seem to divide them.

1052
01:50:14,742 --> 01:50:16,641
They belong to both of us.

1053
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:21,544
Guess I'll just leave them.

1054
01:50:24,498 --> 01:50:26,672
While I was listening downstairs there, I...

1055
01:50:27,404 --> 01:50:31,400
I could remember just as clear
the first time I ever saw you.

1056
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,471
Roger brought you into the Bulletin...

1057
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,308
and I was cussing and pounding
on that old machine.

1058
01:50:38,964 --> 01:50:40,246
Gee, he didn't know we was all

1059
01:50:40,247 --> 01:50:42,800
gonna get to know each other
so well then, did he?

1060
01:50:43,572 --> 01:50:47,129
Would you get the rest of the things
out of the bedroom for me, please?

1061
01:51:20,055 --> 01:51:22,109
I don't blame you, Julie.

1062
01:51:24,423 --> 01:51:26,522
I don't blame you at all.
You should leave me.

1063
01:51:31,254 --> 01:51:33,419
Why don't you say it, honey?
It's all true.

1064
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,323
I haven't done any one of the big things
I planned to do for you.

1065
01:51:39,469 --> 01:51:42,270
We're right where we started.
Still struggling.

1066
01:51:43,871 --> 01:51:45,971
I've let you down all around, honey.

1067
01:51:49,767 --> 01:51:53,502
All I needed to make it 100%
was for you to leave me.

1068
01:51:54,515 --> 01:51:56,831
And I can't think of a reason
in the world for you not to.

1069
01:51:59,585 --> 01:52:01,578
I'm licked, Julie.

1070
01:52:02,729 --> 01:52:05,845
You're not licked, Roger.
It's just us.

1071
01:52:06,757 --> 01:52:09,792
We're licked as far as
our being together is concerned.

1072
01:52:11,645 --> 01:52:14,533
When something really came along
that hit us hard enough

1073
01:52:14,534 --> 01:52:17,300
we couldn't face it together.

1074
01:52:25,131 --> 01:52:28,428
I needed you an awful lot
these last few days...

1075
01:52:29,438 --> 01:52:31,407
but you've been miles away.

1076
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:37,360
I've been entirely alone
right here in this room with you.

1077
01:52:37,489 --> 01:52:39,298
I know, dear.

1078
01:52:55,484 --> 01:52:58,380
I wish I could do something
to help you two.

1079
01:53:00,757 --> 01:53:03,002
It just hasn't worked out.

1080
01:53:08,406 --> 01:53:10,650
It did work out, Julie.

1081
01:53:12,433 --> 01:53:14,962
Things were wonderful
until this happened to us.

1082
01:53:15,855 --> 01:53:17,583
I don't know, I...

1083
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:22,088
I just haven't been able to think
straight for the last few days.

1084
01:53:23,743 --> 01:53:27,809
She was never sick before and then
all of a sudden it was all over.

1085
01:53:30,185 --> 01:53:32,488
If there was only some way
that people could know

1086
01:53:32,489 --> 01:53:34,289
a few days ahead
what was going to happen.

1087
01:53:34,290 --> 01:53:35,290
Yes...

1088
01:53:36,585 --> 01:53:38,554
Then the day before
she was taken sick...

1089
01:53:38,679 --> 01:53:40,968
she asked me for a quarter
and I wouldn't let her have it.

1090
01:53:42,302 --> 01:53:44,373
When she asked me to take her
to the movies I said no

1091
01:53:44,374 --> 01:53:46,074
run along, I'm too busy.

1092
01:53:46,075 --> 01:53:49,483
I know, it was the same with me.

1093
01:53:50,112 --> 01:53:52,642
I was trying on her angel costume and...

1094
01:53:53,735 --> 01:53:56,713
she was so excited
she couldn't stand still.

1095
01:53:57,479 --> 01:53:59,001
I scolded her.

1096
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:03,715
I said, I'll never try
another dress on you again.

1097
01:54:06,053 --> 01:54:07,702
I never did.

1098
01:54:18,558 --> 01:54:19,715
Yes?

1099
01:54:20,916 --> 01:54:22,116
Oh...

1100
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,390
Hello?

1101
01:54:26,831 --> 01:54:28,253
Miss Oliver.

1102
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,046
It's a very strange thing,
Mrs. Adams,

1103
01:54:39,491 --> 01:54:44,496
but we have a little boy
who is just two years old.

1104
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,274
Well, it's the oddest thing.

1105
01:54:53,299 --> 01:54:56,475
He's the exact image of the youngster
you asked for

1106
01:54:56,476 --> 01:54:59,600
when you first wrote to me.
You remember?

1107
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:04,708
I have that old letter
in front of me now.

1108
01:55:06,664 --> 01:55:11,042
Curly hair, blue eyes,
dimple...

1109
01:55:12,862 --> 01:55:14,883
This is strictly off the record.

1110
01:55:14,884 --> 01:55:19,584
But really, another couple
has the right to see him first.

1111
01:55:20,611 --> 01:55:23,487
But he's such a remarkable baby that...

1112
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:29,177
I thought perhaps you and Mr. Adams
would like to take a look.

1113
01:55:30,577 --> 01:55:31,713
Yes.

1114
01:55:34,623 --> 01:55:36,315
Miss Oliver...

1115
01:55:36,816 --> 01:55:40,016
please don't let that other couple
see him until we do, will you?

1116
01:55:41,305 --> 01:55:43,488
I won't, my dear.

1117
01:55:44,505 --> 01:55:46,200
Good bye.

1118
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,124
Well, if he's only two years old,
I'd better put up the gate again, hm?

1119
01:56:10,290 --> 01:56:11,251
Yes.

1120
01:56:11,377 --> 01:56:14,332
I wouldn't want the little fellow falling
down the stairs and breaking his arm.

1121
01:56:14,804 --> 01:56:18,000
I guess we'd better get out the crib.

1122
01:56:19,714 --> 01:56:22,430
As long as he's two years old,
he can sleep on this bed, can't he?

1123
01:56:22,655 --> 01:56:24,007
Sure, sure.

1124
01:56:25,372 --> 01:56:27,755
We won't have to put
the chairs around it.

1125
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,596
And over in that corner
I could put a little electric train.

1126
01:56:37,097 --> 01:56:47,097
