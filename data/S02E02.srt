﻿1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,950
What happened to the pub is
Irish business.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,460
Shut your gypsy mouth
and listen to your
instructions.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,500
Eamonn Duggan?

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,970
My son and my daughter were
taken from me when they were
very small.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,450
We're planning an expansion.
I'm taking premises in London.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,530
The Italian gangs and the Jewish
gangs have been at war in
London.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,250
The Jews have had the worst of
it. They need allies.

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
We take the opportunity
to show our hand.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,450
That arrived an hour ago.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,010
There's no name on it,
but it comes from Camden Town.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,450
Well done, Tommy.
Now you're at war with Sabini.

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,300
~ Ada Shelby? ~ No.
~ Your brother broke the rules.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,570
Sabini.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,500
My face is the last thing
you'll ever see on earth.

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,460
See if the bastard's still
alive.

It's all right, Miss Shelby.
We work with Tommy.

25
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,860
We're Peaky Blinders.

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,860
My name is not Shelby!

27
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,620
Ready for a visitor, Mr Shelby?

28
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,890
No.

29
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,890
I'm here on the King's orders.

30
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,380
I'm afraid I must insist.

31
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,940
Ah, you paid extra for
daylight.

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,890
The racketeering
business must be booming.

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,460
Are you not going to thank me
for saving your life?

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,180
Pass my cigarettes?

35
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,650
Three nights ago,

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,730
at the co-operative stables in
Montague Street,

37
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,770
there was a murder.

38
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,900
A man named Duggan.

39
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,860
The Oxfordshire constabulary
found his body in a shallow
grave.

40
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,740
I need to piss.

41
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,340
Nurse?

42
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,740
I know that it was you who
carried out the murder of
Mr Duggan.

43
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,100
Oh, by the way...

44
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,130
Grace, she went to New York.

45
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,540
A place called, er...

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,500
Poughkeepsie.

47
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,580
She's married now.

48
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,690
To a banker. He's rich.

49
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,380
I am sure she is very happy.

50
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,530
You have been under my
microscope for some weeks now.

51
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,290
I have been observing
every move you make.

52
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,820
That is why I was on hand
to save your life.

53
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,220
I imagine being shot by a woman

54
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,620
hurts the same as being shot
by a man.

55
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,340
Just a bit more shameful.

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,700
You know, Mr Campbell, when I
got shot they gave me a medal.

57
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,340
Yeah.

58
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
(No medal for you I bet.)

59
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,580
Mr Shelby...

60
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,460
our reunion...

61
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,570
..is part of a
very carefully worked out plan,

62
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,940
which has been in place
for some time now.

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,290
Every time you lean on that
stick I bet you see her face.

64
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,300
As a result of the information
in my possession,

65
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,170
I can charge you with murder
at any time

66
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,610
and provide two impeccable
crown witnesses

67
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,250
whose testimony will lead
you directly to the gallows.

68
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,650
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

69
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,580
And from this moment forward...

70
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,260
..you belong to me.

71
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,900
So, get well quickly.

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,250
I'll be in touch the moment I hear
you can piss standing up.

73
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,580
Then I will send
you your instructions.

74
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,850
Curly, you left the gate open?

75
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,810
No, I locked it.
I pinched myself when I did it.

76
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,460
Get this stuff under cover.

77
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,330
Hey!

78
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,420
Who goes there?

79
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,650
Tommy?

80
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,850
Curly, get that oil you put on the
legs when they go lame.

81
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,730
Are you fucking mad, Doyle?

82
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,100
The yellow stuff. Go on.

83
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,650
They said you'd be in for
another three weeks.

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,610
I need to get on a boat to London.

85
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,860
Tonight.

86
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,210
You discharged yourself?

87
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,530
I'm a fucking sitting
duck in there, Charlie.

88
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,850
Sabini could send a man at any time.

89
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,570
I need to get some things done.

90
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,740
You're burning up.

91
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,290
~ Here. ~ Oh, Tommy! That stuff's
for rubbing into fucking horses.

92
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,050
Ha! I am a horse.

93
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,370
If you were a horse, they'd shoot you
with this many broken bones.

94
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,690
Get the black powder, Curly.
Go. The black powder.

95
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,050
You pay for a bloody hospital
and you're using witchcraft?

96
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,290
I need to sleep in the open air and
feel the boat under me, Charlie.

97
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,570
Oh, Tommy.
You're just like your mother.

98
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,420
Do you have a boat here?

99
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,810
Only the January. She's heavy.

100
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,210
London will take four days.

101
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,460
That'll do. Can you spare Curly?

102
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,620
He'll be my doctor.

103
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,690
Then God help you.

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,410
You have tobacco, Curly?

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,050
And tea and whisky. We'll have
you running around like a colt.

106
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,130
Get him aboard. I'll fill her up.

107
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,130
If I sleep all the way, it's Camden
Town we're heading for.

108
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,610
What business do you
have in Camden Town, Tommy?

109
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
Tell Polly she's in charge
while I'm away.

110
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,900
If I don't come back,
tell her she's in charge for good.

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,860
I think I am.

129
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,570
Where are we?

130
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,610
Heathrow.
One more day and we'll be there.

131
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,690
I'll put something in the pan.
Can you steer?

132
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,780
Give it a go.

133
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,060
You're almost there, too, Tommy.

134
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,820
Fucking hell, lads. Calm down.

135
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,170
Put him down, Ollie.
Put him down, mate.

136
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,100
He's only little.

137
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,140
You on your own?

138
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,490
Seems so.

139
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,380
You're a brave lad, ain't you? You
want to take a look at my bakery?

140
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,050
We bake all sorts here mate, yeah.

141
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,610
Did you know we bake
over 10,000 loaves a week?

142
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,290
Can you believe it?

143
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,650
We bake the white bread,
we bake the brown bread.

144
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,500
We bake all sorts.
Would you like to try some?

145
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,490
Bread? Yeah?

146
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,850
All right.

147
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,890
What would you like, brown or white?

148
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,650
Try the brown.

149
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,260
Brown, right.

150
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,890
Not bad...

151
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,740
"Not bad," eh? "Not bad."

152
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,970
It's fucking awful, that stuff.

153
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,700
The fucking brown stuff
is for the workers.

154
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,220
The white stuff, now that IS for
the bosses. Come look.

155
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,050
I've heard very bad,
bad, bad things

156
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,330
about you Birmingham people.

157
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,300
You're Gypsies, right?

158
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,770
So what, do you live in a
fucking tent or a caravan?

159
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,410
I came here to discuss business
with you, Mr Solomons.

160
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,090
Well rum's for fun
and fucking, innit?

161
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,610
So, whisky, now that...

162
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,610
That is for business.

163
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,220
Let's talk first, eh?

164
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,250
Suit yourself.

165
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,580
They say you
had your life saved by a policeman.

166
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,810
I have policemen on my payroll.

167
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,170
I don't like policemen because
policemen, they can't be trusted.

168
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,450
Mr Sabini uses policeman
all the time.

169
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,210
That's why he's winning the war
in London and you are losing it.

170
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
A war ain't over
until it's over, mate.

171
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,860
You were in the war?

172
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,580
I once carried out my own personal
form of stigmata on an Italian.

173
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,490
I pushed his face up against the
trench and shoved a six-inch

174
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,610
nail up his fucking nose and I
hammered it home with a duck board.

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,140
It was fucking biblical, mate.

176
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,570
So don't come in here and sit
there in my chair and tell me

177
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,980
that I'm losing my war
to a fucking wop.

178
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,900
That war was a long time ago.

179
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,650
You need to be more realistic.

180
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,860
"Realistic", yeah?

181
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,450
Realistic?

182
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,450
Well, if you weren't losing the war,
then you wouldn't have sent me

183
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,730
the telegram.

184
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,210
Really?
You forget your fucking telegram.

185
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,890
The telegram just said, "Hello."

186
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,290
Very simple, you want
to sell me something.

187
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,370
What?

188
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,620
~ We join forces.
~ Fuck off.

189
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,770
No!

190
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,860
Categorical.

191
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,650
Fucking ridiculous.

192
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,020
Mr Solomons.

193
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,220
Your distillery
provides one-tenth of your income.

194
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,090
Protection is another 10%.

195
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,900
And the rest you
make from the race tracks.

196
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,770
I know you keep
a gun in the drawer.

197
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,730
I know you keep
it beside the whiskey.

198
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,820
I know you offer a deal or death.

199
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,090
I know what I'm saying
makes you angry.

200
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,810
But I am offering you a solution.
You see, Mr Sabini is running

201
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,650
all your bookies off your courses.

202
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,620
And he is closing down the
premises that take your rum.

203
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,380
And people don't
trust your protection anymore.

204
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,100
You're the bloke who shot
Billy Kimber, right?

205
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,050
You did, you fucking shot him.
That's you.

206
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,650
You fucking betrayed him, mate.

207
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,210
So it'd be entirely
appropriate to do what

208
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
I am thinking in my head to you
right now.

209
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,660
I can offer you 100 good men.
All with weapons.

210
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,610
And a new relationship with
the police.

211
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,810
Intelligence. Intelligence is a very
valuable thing, innit, my friend?

212
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,020
And usually it comes far
too fucking late.

213
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,180
Let's say I shot you already,
right, in the fucking face.

214
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,130
And the bullet goes bone, mush,
bone, cabinet over there.

215
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,130
Which is a shame, innit,

216
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,850
cos that cabinet's fucked now
and I got to get shot of it.

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,010
So, what I'd do is this...

218
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,660
It's fucking simple, mate.

219
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,970
I cut that cabinet in half, don't I?

220
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,940
I do I just literally... I cut...

221
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,740
I cut the cabinet
literally in half, mate.

222
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,010
And I take one half
of the cabinet, all right,

223
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,610
and put it into a barrel and I take
the other half of the cabinet

224
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,330
in all its pieces and I put that
into another barrel, right?

225
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,930
And I send this barrel
off to Mandalay.

226
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,810
And the other barrel off
to somewhere like...

227
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,260
I don't know...

228
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,890
Timbuktu.

229
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,610
~ You ever been? ~ No.

230
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,100
No?

231
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,780
Would you like to go?

232
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,580
No.

233
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,010
You know, I always thought

234
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,100
that you'd have a great, big,
fucking gold ring in your nose.

235
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,260
I'm sorry, go on.

236
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,660
Tell us your plan.

237
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,850
Ada.

238
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,050
How the fuck did you find me?

239
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,170
What, are you reading
Polly's letters?

240
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,690
Polly showed me the letter.

241
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,610
Look, you think you're safe because
you moved flat, but you're not.

242
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,890
~ Polly thinks the same.
~ When will you understand?

243
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,660
~ I just want you all out of my life.
~ Ada, look at us, eh?

244
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,090
~ And it'll happen again.
~ Yeah, well, next time I'll be ready.

245
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,730
In fact, I want them to try again
cos I'll shoot their balls off!

246
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,450
~ Ada, put the fucking gun away.
~ Get away from me, I'm late for work.

247
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,740
All right, fine. Fine.

248
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,700
Just take this. Take it.

249
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,810
Where you're living now is right
on the edge of Sabini's territory

250
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,890
and all the coppers round there
work for him.

251
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,850
I've got a lot of money coming in
that I can't put through the banks.

252
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,610
My accountant says the best thing
is to buy property for cash

253
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,740
and put it in the name
of a family member.

254
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,450
A house? A whole house?

255
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,860
It's all yours.

256
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,450
Four storeys, eight bedrooms,
kitchen, scullery...

257
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,100
Rooms for a maid, if your
political conscience will allow.

258
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,460
At least go and have a look, eh?

259
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,300
Shoot the fucking lot of them.

260
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,220
Mr Sabini? The police are here.

261
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,020
Tell them to wipe their feet.

262
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,330
So why do I
have to tell YOU everything?

263
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,570
We can't search every train
that comes into London.

264
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,700
They don't use trains,
they use boats.

265
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,890
The boatmen are all Gypsies.
He's a fucking Gypsy.

266
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,690
Why do we have to tell them
everything?

267
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,980
OK, we can't search every boat.

268
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,610
Lucky for me...

269
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,530
I have a boy in the Jews' rum house.

270
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,890
The Gypsy went to meet Solomons.

271
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,370
And after, they drank whisky
and shook hands...

272
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,250
and then Alfie gave him
some salt or...

273
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,970
some such kike thing
that means peace.

274
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,860
What exactly d'you want us to do,
Mr Sabini?

275
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,940
Did you bring dog shit in here
on your shoes?

276
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,540
Check, have a look.

277
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,010
I can smell something.

278
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,690
You've got photographs of this
Tommy Shelby, though, right?

279
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,410
We have military ID photographs

280
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,850
from his time
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry.

281
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
Shelby won medals.

282
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,730
OK, so you've got his fucking photo.

283
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,100
If he shows his face in Camden Town,
your coppers lift him. All right?

284
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,290
You know...

285
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,610
..sometimes when I smell something,
it's something that's not real,

286
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:31,490
it's something more like a...
Like a premonition.

287
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,770
It's like sometimes
I smell something,

288
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,740
but it's not a smell, it's just...

289
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,690
..something isn't right.

290
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,180
Mr Sabini, we'll do everything we can
to deal with this man.

291
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Deal?

292
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,380
Did you say, "Do a deal"?

293
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,210
I didn't mean that.

294
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,980
Fuck.

295
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,700
Fuck.

296
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,250
~ You've been fucking got at.
~ No, you're being ridiculous.

297
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,210
Somebody's fucking sat you down.

298
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,050
Somebody's fucking
sat you down and talked to you!

299
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,810
~ Mr Sabini... ~ We should go.

300
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,530
This fucking Gypsy has sat down
with the fucking coppers!

301
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,170
~ Mr Sabini. ~ You fucking...

302
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,650
..and you're taking
with both fucking hands -

303
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,580
off of me and off of him!

304
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,210
OK. So now YOU fucking
follow Shelby.

305
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,940
You fucking follow him
and you finish him!

306
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,340
Oh...

307
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,300
Oh, shit!

308
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,730
I told yous, boys, 'ere she is.

309
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,500
What the bloody hell is going on?

310
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,050
When did you get back?

311
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,290
I didn't want to
miss your birthday, Pol.

312
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,810
Back to work.

313
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,170
How d'you know it's my birthday?
Nobody ever knows.

314
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,570
Ah, it's different this year.
John, Finn, bring the car round.

315
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,780
~ Where are we going? ~ To unwrap
your birthday present. After you.

316
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,460
Good morning!

317
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,980
~ You said you were gonna buy Ada
a house. ~ Yep, that's right, I did.

318
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,060
Just had a bit of cash left over.

319
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,300
This is ours?

320
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,620
No, Polly...

321
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,780
..this is yours.

322
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,340
Cos you deserve it.

323
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,420
What would I do
with all these rooms?

324
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,580
Well, you could...relax for one.

325
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,260
Come here at weekends.

326
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,420
It has a garden, eh?

327
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,850
You love gardens.
You can grow roses, Pol.

328
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,410
I don't know, have a piano.

329
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,970
Have people round,
they can have a singsong, eh?

330
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,620
~ God help the bloody neighbours(!)
~ Fuck the neighbours.

331
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,060
Welcome home, Pol.

332
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,060
Arthur, why don't you take the boys
outside and wait by the car.

333
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,380
Pol...

334
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,580
I know you haven't been happy
for a while.

335
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,580
And I know why.

336
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,060
Esme is all right, you know?

337
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,140
She's got a good heart, she has.

338
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,900
I've spoken to her...

339
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,020
..and she told me.

340
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,620
Told you what?

341
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,460
She told me what it is
that would make you happy.

342
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,770
I've spoken to our contacts
in the police.

343
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,290
They have contacts in the council,

344
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,260
and they have contacts with the
people who keep the parish records.

345
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,740
Records of adoptions...

346
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,500
..and of confidential
forced removals.

347
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,260
Now, with your permission...

348
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,970
.. I'd like to grease a few palms

349
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,980
and take a look at the records
they never showed you.

350
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,130
Pol...

351
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,010
I am going to find
your son and daughter

352
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,860
and I'm gonna bring them home.

353
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,810
That's what this house is for.

354
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,500
So that YOU can bring
your family home where they belong.

355
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,180
We're moving up, Pol.

356
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,820
Go have a look what you think.

357
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,050
Can you hear that?

358
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,770
'Gah!'

359
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,460
Silence at last.

360
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,620
~ And it belongs to us.
~ 'Gah...'

361
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,730
'Mummy...'

362
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,570
What's in there?

363
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,700
MUSIC: Pull A U

Well, there's a lot coming in
and a lot going out.

371
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,260
Well, as long as there's more
coming in, we're all right.

372
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,020
This came for you today.

373
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,010
It's all the way from America,
New York.

374
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,580
Somewhere called Poughkeepsie?

375
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,250
And the decorators doing
The Garrison want paying.

376
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,570
Arthur forgot and pulled a gun
when they asked, so...

377
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,450
they've stopped
and everything's green.

378
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,090
All right, well, just pay it.

379
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,650
Oh, and we need to put an advert
in the Mail -

380
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,970
"Garrison: Grand Reopening."

381
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,970
Oh, and you said there's a letter
that had to go today.

382
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,660
Special delivery.
I wrote it in the diary.

383
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,170
Yes... I haven't written it out yet.

384
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,810
Well, you can just tell me
and I'll write it down.

385
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,900
I've learnt shorthand.

386
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,300
Fair enough.

387
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,020
Dear Mr Churchill...

388
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,220
Has your pencil broken?

389
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,410
No. No, do go on.

390
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,220
Dear Mr Churchill...

391
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:53,170
I've been approached by an agent
of the Crown to carry out a task,

392
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,090
as yet unspecified.

393
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,820
'His name is Major Campbell
and I believe he reports to you.'

394
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,010
'Therefore, I decided to make
direct contact with you

395
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,340
'to make sure that certain things
are clearly understood.'

396
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,090
' "Mr Churchill, you should know
that I am a former British soldier

397
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,290
' "and if you look at my war record,

398
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,130
' "you will see that I fought
bravely at Verdun and at the Somme'

399
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,130
"Also, you will see
that my actions at Mons

400
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,730
"saved thousands of Allied lives.

401
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,610
"I know that you resigned
your ministerial position

402
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,570
"and the safety of an office

403
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,290
"to go and fight on the front line
with the men.

404
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,490
"I read that you fought bravely,
Mr Churchill.

405
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,050
"Therefore, I hope I will be treated
in any dealings we have

406
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,370
"with a degree of respect,
soldier to soldier.

407
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,250
"My demands are slight and my
sacrifice in service of my country

408
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,090
"will no doubt once again be great.

409
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,820
"Yours sincerely, Thomas Shelby."

410
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,660
Military Medal and the DCM...

411
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,900
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

412
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,860
Hands up in this room,
those who were at the Somme.

413
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,020
Those who were at
the Battle of Verdun?

414
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,940
Thomas Shelby was a tunneller.

415
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,530
His demand is rather amusing.

416
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,890
He has asked that
the Colonial Office grant him

417
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,850
an Empire export licence.

418
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,130
Specifically a licence covering
India, Malay Peninsula,

419
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,130
Canada and Russia.

420
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,690
He plans to transport certain
manufactured goods from Birmingham

421
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,770
to the Poplar Docks.

422
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,650
And you plan to agree to this demand?

423
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,940
Dear God, Major Campbell...

424
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,930
We will be asking this man
to carry out an assassination

425
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,890
on behalf of the Crown,

426
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,770
once more risking his life.

427
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,570
These demands by comparison
are slight and easily met

428
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,970
with a few quiet words over lunch
with the appropriate ministers.

429
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,650
Sir...with the greatest respect...

430
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,300
Thomas Shelby is a murdering...

431
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,220
..cut-throat, mongrel, gangster.

432
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,930
And yet, the tunnels were dug
beneath our feet to silence the guns

433
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,420
pointed at our heads.

434
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,010
Get Thomas Shelby's details
from Campbell

435
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,690
and get some kind of
royal appointment stamp.

436
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,690
Temporary.

437
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,530
~ Temporary?
~ Just until the deed is done.

438
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,250
Agreed, Major Campbell?

439
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,420
And then I can...
proceed as discussed?

440
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,860
Agreed, sir.

441
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,700
Come on, let's go in.

442
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,100
Here, pass the ball!

443
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,700
Come on.

444
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,610
'Come on in, boys.
Did you have a good game?'

445
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,090
'I'm starving,
have you done anything for lunch?'

446
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,490
It'll be on in a minute, in you go.

447
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,610
Go in and wash your hands, boys,
all right?

448
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,850
'Come on, mister.'

449
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,820
Mrs Johnson?

450
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,180
Yes. Who are you?

451
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,940
I'm from Birmingham Council,
Bordesley parish.

452
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,610
No-one wrote to me. What d'you want?

453
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,850
I would like to talk about your son,
about Henry.

454
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,410
Can I come in?

455
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,610
I'd rather you didn't,
he doesn't like to talk about this.

456
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,300
I see.

457
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,620
So what does Henry know about
his real identity, Mrs Johnson?

458
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,810
I only deal with Mr Ross from the
agency and he only ever writes, so...

459
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,450
Why are you here in person?

460
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,820
Well, the boy is approaching
his 18th birthday.

461
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,100
This isn't right!

462
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,770
You're not from the council,
something isn't right.

463
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,180
Hmm. What does he know, Mrs Johnson?

464
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,740
He knows his mother couldn't cope.

465
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,900
She drank too much, she used opium...
she used to beat him.

466
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,650
But that isn't the truth, is it?

467
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,610
Look, I think you should come back
when my husband's here.

468
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,170
Does he know what his real name is?

469
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,930
His real name is Johnson,
Henry Johnson,

470
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,290
now I would like you to go away and
come back when my husband's here.

471
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,210
The truth is he was taken from his
mother without her permission.

472
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,530
~ Henry, go back inside, please.
~ Who are you?

473
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,570
~ Please, Henry, go on!
~ Your real name is Michael Gray.

474
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,130
~ No!
~ Your real mother wants to see you.

475
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,530
Her address is on the back of this
card. She just wants to talk.

476
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,290
~ Go away. ~ She just wants to talk.

477
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,140
Go away and leave us alone. Go away!

478
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,130
Come on, let's go back inside.

479
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,980
Come on,
I'll get you something to eat.

480
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,620
Come on, Henry.

481
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,660
Come on... Come on.

482
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,220
Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, Finn.

483
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,250
Hit him, that's right.

484
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,010
All right, Isiah, your turn.

485
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,700
Finn! Call yourself a Shelby?
Fucking hit him, for fuck's sake!

486
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,620
Hit him.

487
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,770
Get him out of there, get him back!

488
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,530
Get him back!
Arthur, for fuck's sake!

489
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,100
Get him out of there!

490
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,660
Rockfair is down to sixes...

491
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,260
Right, what happened?

492
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,370
~ It was a fair fight. ~ Yeah.

493
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,540
Arthur just caught him
with a good 'un.

494
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,130
I saw the body,
don't fucking lie to me.

495
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,620
I saw the body,
what fucking happened?

496
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,980
I'm not family, I'm saying nothing.

497
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,580
Arthur...

498
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,900
..he's blown a few times lately.

499
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,940
Six, seven.

500
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,700
It's like he's not there
in the head.

501
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,020
He can't even hear "stop".
Even his own name.

502
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,580
And then he cries.

503
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,900
Right, listen to me.

504
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,020
That's two fucking stories.

505
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,010
Your brother killed a boy.

506
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,490
There were witnesses,
there will be questions,

507
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,450
get your story straight,
it was an accident.

508
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,020
Fuck off.

509
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,260
I spoke to the doctor,
he said the kid...

510
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,410
..probably had a weak heart.

511
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,780
We'll look after his mother.

512
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,940
It'll be fine.

513
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,500
Polly said I should have stuck
with the medicine.

514
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,700
I said that you know best.

515
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,420
It's like a fucking boat, Tommy.

516
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,700
Full of heavy cargo,
like coal or iron.

517
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,620
Sometimes it slips to one end.

518
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,700
And the boat tips.

519
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,620
I can feel it slipping.

520
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,340
And I can...feel the boat tipping.

521
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,700
But there ain't nothing
I can do about it.

522
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,090
It's like me fuckin' head's
just like this fuckin'...

523
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,330
black fucking barge!

524
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,250
And it just fucking...drifts...

525
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,570
in and out, in and out...

526
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,330
Well, we're home a long time now,
Arthur.

527
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,780
We've home a long time.

528
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,410
~ I thought you were all right.
~ Yeah, well...

529
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,140
I-I-I don't think I am... Tommy.

530
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,020
Take this fucking thing
away from me.

531
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,300
Just fuck off, Arthur.

532
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,340
You know what?

533
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,570
I've had enough.

534
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,890
I've fucking had enough.
Just fuck off.

535
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,220
(What?)

536
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm supposed to treat you
like a fucking kid again, eh?

537
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,100
Keep you away from guns
and fucking rope, is that it?

538
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,410
You think I haven't got
enough on?!

539
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,690
~ Stop it, Tommy. ~ Arthur?

540
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,130
~ You think I haven't got enough on?!
~ Stop it.

541
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,330
~ The war is done!
Shut the door on it! ~ Stop it.

542
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,650
~ Shut the door on it, like I did, eh?
~ Like you do?

543
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,890
Can you do that? Yeah?

544
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,610
~ Like I fucking did.
~ I'm not fucking you.

545
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,530
~ Shut the fucking door, eh?
~ But I'm not fucking you!

546
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,130
I...am not fucking you!

547
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,490
Everyone fucking knows it!

548
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,900
God!

549
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,700
Look at yourself. Eh?

550
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,570
Look at yourself.

551
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,580
Take a long, hard,
fucking look at yourself.

552
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,850
Time for lunch, sir.

553
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,820
I thought we could eat at the desk,
like the old days.

554
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,690
You remembered.

555
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,570
Tongue and pickle, sir.

556
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,250
But it's the single stroke
of mustard, that's the thing.

557
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,340
~ Hmm. ~ The fine detail.

558
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,540
Speaking of detail...

559
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,460
How much is Thomas Shelby
paying you in bribes per week? Hm?

560
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,210
Actually, I already know -
£2 a week, £8 a month,

561
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,940
plus extras for specific favours.

562
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:11,090
When I left, you were an honest man.

563
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,900
And now you're on
the Peaky Blinders' payroll.

564
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,090
Shelby is a worm and feeds off
the rotten parts of your mind.

565
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,810
He gets in through your ear,
with a whisper.

566
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:32,220
He crawls in over your tongue as you
lie to the judge and the pastor.

567
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,820
Mr Moss...

568
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:40,410
We are entering a bloody phase
of a bloody war

569
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,940
with no quarter asked or given.

570
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,140
But as of this moment, you are now
back on the side of the angels.

571
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,540
Shelby thinks you work for him,
but in truth, you work for me.

572
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,860
And I will use you mercilessly.

573
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,420
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

574
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,860
As you can see, one is white...

575
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,900
..and one is black.

576
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,780
What you saw in your dreams...

577
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,500
..was right.

578
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,220
Your daughter is dead.

579
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,300
Um... You do it, I can't read it.

580
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,780
After Anna was taken from you,
she was put with a...

581
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,620
With a family of a...
railway station master in Stafford.

582
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,130
She...never settled.

583
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,500
So she kept running away.

584
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,970
She got on a train
to Birmingham once...

585
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,860
Eventually they sent her
to Australia...

586
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,460
..where she died of something
called spring fever.

587
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,340
So my little Anna...

588
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,650
..travelled all the way
back across the world

589
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,220
to be with me in my dreams?

590
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,140
She came all by herself.

591
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,380
Well...that's one train
they couldn't get her off.

592
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,300
But, Pol...

593
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,500
.. Michael is alive.

594
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,380
He's in England...

595
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,340
..and I know where he lives,
I went there.

596
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,060
~ But, Pol... ~ And?

597
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,420
OK, Polly, listen to me.

598
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,060
Just listen to me, please.

599
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,850
Pol!

600
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,780
The woman that he calls "mother"
will never let him come here.

601
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,580
Just tell me where he is, Tommy.

602
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,890
Polly, if you go there
and you get mad

603
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,810
and she gets mad
and she calls the police,

604
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,050
they will never let you
anywhere near him

605
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,140
and the boy will get scared.

606
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,220
That's what will happen, Pol.

607
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,380
Polly.

608
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,980
~ Polly...
~ You just tell me where he is, Thomas.

609
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,220
~ Tell me where he is, Thomas! ~ Polly...

610
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,500
Pulling the gun...

611
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,660
Pulling the gun
is why I can't tell you.

612
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,450
Pol, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to wait till he's 18.

613
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,620
Till he's old enough
to make his own decision.

614
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,740
Wait?!

615
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,780
You tell me where he is!

616
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,020
If you shoot me, you'll never know.

No, look at me.

Get out.

633
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,620

00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,820
This is what we do.

637
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,420
It's called Tokyo.

638
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:25,860
It's good stuff, Arthur.
It'll help you.

639
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,260
For special occasions.

640
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,860
Oh, boys! My fucking Garrison!

641
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,610
Take that. Take that an' all.

642
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,050
'Ere you are, Lizzie.
Let me get you a light.

643
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,170
There you go, my darling. Jeremiah,
I'll be with you in a second.

644
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,650
Oh!

645
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,460
Look at the place!

646
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,290
~ You all right? ~ Busier we are,
the faster time passes.

647
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,740
Yeah?

648
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:25,250
Arthur...
Tokyo, it's fuel for races, eh?

649
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,460
~ But you've seen a doped horse
after a race... ~ Oh, yeah.

650
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,780
Grand openings and race days only,
brother.

651
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,050
~ All right?
~ 'Go on then, Tommy!'

652
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,450
~ 'There you go, come on, drink up.'
~ Boys.

653
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,010
All right, Mick?

654
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:43,420
~ Tom. ~ Finn! Gimme that.

655
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,180
Keep him off the whisky, John.

656
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,980
Pol.

657
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,450
~ Ada! I didn't know you were coming.
~ There's Aunt Polly.

658
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,260
~ Aww... ~ Hi!

659
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,730
Hey, who's that?

660
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,170
~ D'you want a cuddle?
~ Polly, that's right.

661
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,410
~ Take him. ~ Polly...

662
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,130
~ Oh, Ada, why don't you think
about coming home? ~ Hello, Ada.

663
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,300
Say you'd...

664
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,050
Tommy...

665
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,490
~ So what do you think, eh?
~ It's very...

666
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,020
~ Gold? ~ Yeah.

667
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,170
~ Hello, Ada.
~ Hello, trouble, how're you doing?

668
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,970
~ Mmmm...
~ Oh, you're...spilling my drink!

669
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,050
Hey, Arthur, look who it is.

670
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,810
So what d'you want me
to say to her?

671
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,850
Just talk to her.
No-one can get through to her.

672
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,260
Tell her I had no choice.

673
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,140
I appreciate this.

674
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:31,610
~ Hello, brother.
~ Ada, come here, you!

675
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,090
You big bear!

676
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,500
Polly?
Why don't you come and join us?

677
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,180
~ What? ~ I'm not an idiot.

678
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,940
He asked you to come, didn't he?

679
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,770
I don't want conversation,
I want an address.

680
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,180
Until I have that...

681
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,170
.. I've not got anything to say.

682
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,570
~ Now, it's a party! ~ Yeah...

683
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,460
It is! Oh!

684
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,860
~ And I'm going to enjoy myself.
~ No, Pol, don't be silly.

685
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,780
Excuse me?

686
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,260
Would you care to dance?

687
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,500
It'd...be my pleasure.

688
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,460
My love,
pleasure hasn't even begun.

689
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,940
Excuse me?

690
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,540
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

691
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,620
I was told she lived here
at number 17.

692
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,980
I came last night
but there was nobody here.

693
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,300
So I waited.

694
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,020
What do you want
with Elizabeth Gray?

695
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,740
I think she might be my mother.
