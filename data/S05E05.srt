1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:03,498
My name is Brilliant Chang.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,319
Mr Thomas...

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,319
...it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,239
Came off a ship called the Capital,
out of Shanghai.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,519
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,959
Canals are the idea, right, Chang?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,759
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,119
Your message said you wanted to seal
our truce with some business.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,359
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,159
I need your signature as a guarantor
on the transaction

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,479
The war with the Billy Boys
is postponed. We've made peace.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to do business together.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,275
There's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself

15
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:48,469
and I keep finding myself there.

16
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,519
And only the January can get me away.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,679
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,000
He just listened. And now he has no face.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,039
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,679
- Clear that shit. Clear it!

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,960
- All right.
- Take her.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,439
Go outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,100
Linda, I would have taken your bullet.

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,919
I deserved the bullet.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,639
An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth!

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,759
Linda!

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,079
Linda, look at me.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,169
Linda, you've got a kid.

29
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,559
If you die, he'll come to us to raise.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,840
You hear me?

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,119
I used a derringer.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,839
- Shh!
- Right.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,599
- Shh!
- It's still in there. It's above the bone.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,359
Mr Shelby, your guests.

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,719
Get him out. Arthur!

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,120
Family only. Get him out!

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,640
- Mr Shelby...
- Get out!

38
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:24,613
Get out!

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,300
Lizzie, go to the kitchen
and get some iodine. Now! Go!

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,640
Shh...

41
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,119
Linda...

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,719
You'll have to bite on this.

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,239
- Linda... Arthur.
- Bite! Come here.

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,439
Now, it's really going to hurt.

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,719
One, two, three...

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,788
You're all right. You're all right.

47
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,759
- It's all over.
- Hold her.

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,359
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Is she going to be all right, Tom?

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,559
Yeah.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,721
Oh, Jesus.

51
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,399
Arthur, come here. Come here.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,639
If you love her, go to the library,
get some opium.

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,300
Go on. She'll be fine. Go sort it. Right.

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,620
Actually, you can use mine.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,920
Brought a bit to celebrate
the wedding proposal.

56
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:39,220
Oh! He proposed, eh?

57
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,973
One knee.

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,940
Congratulations, Poll.

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,719
Linda...

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,319
Linda...

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,119
You're going to have to drink this. No.

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,719
I don't want anything you've touched.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,919
25 seconds. 25 seconds
and the pain will be gone.

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,919
Even the pain in your head.

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,700
Right, here you go. Drink.

66
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,420
Cushion, Poll.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
Right.

68
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,399
Oh, Jesus Christ...

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,240
Arthur...

70
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,878
She's going to be fine.

71
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,039
I gave her something to get her to sleep.

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,360
She's going to be fine.

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,119
You should have... You should have
let her do it, Poll.

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,200
You should have let her do it.

75
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:39,946
Arthur...

76
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,679
You should have let her do it.

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,519
Look at me, brother! Look at me!

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,666
You've got things to do.

79
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,079
You've got a kid.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,039
- Yeah.
- We need you!

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,399
- All right? You understand?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,079
Aberama wants you as best man.

83
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,559
You hear that?

84
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:02,353
I save his life, he hugs him.

85
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,247
Oh...

86
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,119
I'll do it.

87
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,820
No take.

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,900
Right, fine. Let him be. Let him be.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,340
Ladies and gentlemen...

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,120
Ladies and gentlemen...

91
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,719
...I would like to extend
our gratitude to the musicians

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,879
and the dance company
for your wonderful performance.

93
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,959
Hear, hear!

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,720
This has been a wonderful evening.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,780
And not only
for the music and the dancing.

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,620
It has also been about us,
the people gathered here.

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,988
English people
in the very heart of England.

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,119
There are no people
I would rather be among,

99
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,599
no place I would rather be
and no time I would rather be alive,

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,519
because ever since
the terrible events of October,

101
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,219
when the money markets betrayed us all...

102
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,120
...I have known that change is coming.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,919
The human species has never faced
such immense possibilities,

104
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
such choices.

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
In the lives of great nations...

106
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,480
...there are moments of destiny...

107
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,847
...which have swept aside
small men of convention

108
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:38,439
and discovered men of the moment.

109
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:43,199
- Hear, hear!
- And our host is such a man.

110
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,679
For him...

111
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,620
For him, the little calculations
of little men mean nothing.

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,719
He is a man well suited
to the mighty mood

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,279
that England is now in.

114
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,399
The only reason I say this now,

115
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,599
at this moment, on this stage,

116
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,740
is because I have some news.

117
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,439
Good news, I think.

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,159
I'm sure our host will forgive me
if I use this platform,

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,999
this gathering of friends and like minds,

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,556
to give you, his trusted allies,

121
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:25,180
an early announcement
of a long-overdue event.

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,700
I want to tell you good folk first...

123
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,120
...that with the dawn of a new decade...

124
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,199
...I will be setting a new course,

125
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,719
setting up a new political movement
here in the very heart of England.

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,359
And Mr Shelby will be with me,

127
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,079
shoulder to shoulder.

128
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,680
Hear, hear!

129
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,639
It will offer
a new conception of politics

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,799
in which the great character
of the British,

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,239
our true character,

132
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,500
will be reborn.

133
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,780
Many of you lost fortunes
in the recent stock market crash.

134
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,180
The men of money,

135
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,079
the capitalists in New York,

136
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,020
the Jews...

137
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,039
...the money-power, they... they run
an international system

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,959
in which the infinite mobility of money,

139
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,363
its capacity to create
financial chaos and panic,

140
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,959
can bring down any government

141
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,720
that dares for one moment to oppose it.

142
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,119
For generations,

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,199
the efforts of hard-working men like you

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,559
have equipped our competitors against us.

145
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,199
The cotton mills of India.

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,919
The cotton mills of Asia.

147
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,198
Created with British money

148
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,639
but used for the destruction
of Lancashire and Yorkshire!

149
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,199
Disgraceful!

150
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,119
The usurers of New York,
the sweated labour of the Orient

151
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,199
combining to destroy
the iron and steel factories

152
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,519
of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

153
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,679
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

154
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,319
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance!

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,559
They are the ones who took your money,

156
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,919
but it is I and those who know this truth

157
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,639
who will light a flame
the atheists cannot extinguish!

158
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,599
The ranks of our heroes of the Great War

159
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,999
have been betrayed
again and again by politicians!

160
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,879
But hear this, those of you
who fought the Jew war for nothing,

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,920
you brave men,

162
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:54,479
you will join hands
with the angry youth of Birmingham

163
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,950
and Manchester and London and Liverpool

164
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:01,439
and declare that England lives tonight

165
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
and marches on!

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,959
Well said!

167
00:10:06,782 --> 00:10:08,680
I say all this to you now...

168
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,679
...because I believe
it is in places like this,

169
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,159
with people like you,

170
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,144
that we will have to pass on
our message directly.

171
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:19,439
Our message can be summarised
with these words,

172
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,639
Britain first.

173
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
As it should be!

174
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,159
And because this is our message,

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,639
I doubt it'll be reported
fairly in the press.

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,159
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

177
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,160
are owned by the same vested
interests who took your money.

178
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,039
They sell to the people false news...

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,039
...to raise the interests of
the faction and the section

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,239
above the interests of the nation.

181
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,199
- Good man!
- So hear my words

182
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,839
and pass them on
to those with ears to hear.

183
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,728
And be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

184
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,839
there will be the birth
of a new political party

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,839
which will speak for you.

186
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,279
Well said, sir.

187
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,479
Well said!

188
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,020
This party, this new movement,
this revolution...

189
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,799
...will be called
the British Union of Fascists.

190
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,240
Bravo!

191
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,479
Good man!

192
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,580
What the fuck are you doing,
dealing with a man like that, Tommy?

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,079
Yep. You're going to have to trust me.

194
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,479
Again.

195
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm going to fuck the swan.

196
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,799
Somebody go and tell her
to come to my room.

197
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,847
How do you know she'll come?

198
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,520
Because they always do.

199
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,759
Now, forgive me.

200
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,140
I'm going to borrow your husband
for a little while.

201
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,120
This way.

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,039
Things like tonight, that shooting,
a family dispute in public,

203
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,559
things like that will have to stop.

204
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,399
It's very lower class.

205
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,980
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.

206
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,159
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

207
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,999
Yes.

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
Yes, I learned many things.

209
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,100
Religion was a beast, but it's dead.

210
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,399
You have to ride the new thing
when it comes.

211
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,080
Like a horse.

212
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
You grab it.

213
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,399
I looked into the audience
and I saw medals

214
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,479
and Savile Row suits

215
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,800
and bitterness.

216
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,780
They are my people.
Your people will be different.

217
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,360
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.

218
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,246
I do.

219
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,486
I do see the funny side.

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,839
Do you enjoy strategies?

221
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,199
Yes, I do.

222
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,599
Things will begin to happen now.

223
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,100
So...

224
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,839
...there are some things
we need to discuss.

225
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,519
I've been looking into your companies.

226
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,620
The Shelby portfolio.

227
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,500
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

228
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,727
He will have to go.

229
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,875
Of course.

230
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:08,165
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern

231
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,633
has asked for control of
the racecourses north of Wincanton.

232
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,959
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

233
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,200
so I said yes.

234
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,300
In return for what?

235
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,600
No return.

236
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,046
None.

237
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,639
When our campaign begins,

238
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,599
the country will be divided
into distinct areas.

239
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,799
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

240
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,279
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

241
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,519
In the Midlands, it'll be you.

242
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,120
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.

243
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,479
Please understand what I'm offering
you as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

244
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,980
When we succeed,
even the King will not be above us.

245
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,106
Power.

246
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,400
Like plugging into the mains.

247
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:16,407
A lighthouse beam.

248
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,559
Your millions of dollars
safe in Switzerland,

249
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,200
and access to every dirty-minded
swan in England.

250
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,440
Oh, and also, Shelby... drink less.

251
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,200
Put it on.

252
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
Put the costume back on.

253
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,400
The ballerina and I were wondering
whether perhaps...

254
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,559
...you might want to join us.

255
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,039
If I told Tommy,
you wouldn't see the morning.

256
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,300
Oh, I doubt that very much.

257
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,980
You see, he is being seduced,
just as you were.

258
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
Tommy.

259
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:34,873
Tommy!

260
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,720
- Tom!
- What?!

261
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,340
Lizzie... What?!

262
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,719
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.

263
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,999
That man is fucking evil.

264
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,580
Lizzie...

265
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,679
I'm only doing this...

266
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,479
...to bring the bastard down.

267
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,660
Yeah, but why?

268
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,280
Tommy? Why?

269
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,959
I am supplying the British Government

270
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,999
with information on his organisation,

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,759
and in return,

272
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,479
they are giving me favourable terms
on defence contracts.

273
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,406
No.

274
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,799
You're doing it because you think
somebody should stop him.

275
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,140
I saw your face when he was speaking.

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,119
You're doing it because you think
it's the right thing to do.

277
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,919
All this time, you just did things
that feel nice...

278
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,759
...because you can afford it.

279
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,620
Lizzie, please. Please. Please stop.

280
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,679
Don't scare me...

281
00:18:37,912 --> 00:18:40,752
...by saying you see things in my face.

282
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:44,513
I still want things that feel nice.

283
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,033
Linda...

284
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,920
Shh. Shh.

285
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,140
Linda...

286
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,719
Let's go.

287
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,839
Hmm?

288
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:21,840
Let's go, let's leave.

289
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,280
Let's get in the car.
We'll go and pick up Billy.

290
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,079
We'll drive to the docks.

291
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:31,866
Any dock you want.

292
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,799
We'll get on a boat.

293
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,439
We'll sail away.

294
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,800
You and me.

295
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,040
Any destination.

296
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,740
Be careful, it's...

297
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:53,353
It's broken everywhere.

298
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,200
We leave tonight. Hmm?

299
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,639
We'd leave this place.

300
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:03,693
We never come back, Linda.

301
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,240
We never come back.

302
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,519
I mean that.

303
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
We go before it gets light.

304
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,680
Say yes.

305
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,140
I've got a better idea.

306
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,180
You stay here...

307
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:31,027
...living inside your head.

308
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:34,866
Inside your life. Inside your war.

309
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

310
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,066
It would have been a kindness.

311
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,940
Now get out.

312
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,146
Please...

313
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,280
An evening with a bunch
of fucking Gypsies.

314
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!

315
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,800
Kick it here, mister!

316
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,920
This is a cheque guarantee,
signed by Mosley...

317
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,159
...on behalf of a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

318
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,719
A cheque for what?

319
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,839
Well, I said it was
for the sale of a gin distillery.

320
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,200
But it doesn't matter.

321
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,956
It is direct evidence of a link
between Mosley

322
00:23:25,981 --> 00:23:28,639
and the head
of an organised criminal network,

323
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,760
a relationship he will try to deny...

324
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:35,673
...after the bonfire of all conventions.

325
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,959
It also contains the names of MPs
who have signed up to the movement

326
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,039
and those MPs who are sympathetic

327
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,379
but will not show their hand

328
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,559
until the organisation
is announced officially.

329
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:50,087
On the 2nd of January.

330
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,599
In Grosvenor House. You might want
to write some of this down.

331
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,380
I am experiencing resistance
from my superior officers, too.

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,960
This isn't intelligence, Younger.

333
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,839
This is evidence.

334
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,399
Give it to the Branch.

335
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,759
Special Branch?

336
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,599
Half of whom spend their lives
defending the Union against Fenians

337
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,006
and the other half who spend their lives

338
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:16,788
defending men like Mosley
against socialists.

339
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:19,639
I heard about his speech
at your house the other night.

340
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,159
Was favourably reported as the passionate

341
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,719
and spontaneous outpouring of a man
moved by the emotions of a ballet.

342
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,999
Reported where?

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,162
Daily Mail. Morning Post. Daily Mirror.

344
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,159
It's upper, middle and working class,

345
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,400
all united in admiration.

346
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,319
Also, I'm being asked the source
of my information on Mosley.

347
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,759
Which you don't divulge?

348
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,000
No.

349
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:49,233
And as a result, my six-monthly
review was unfavourable.

350
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,239
They're talking about moving me

351
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,320
to a black and coloured desk
in Johannesburg.

352
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,159
I also suspect there are
specific threats to me personally

353
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,480
from an organisation called Section D.

354
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,920
I believe you've had a dispute
with them in the past.

355
00:25:07,913 --> 00:25:09,353
Sit down, Younger.

356
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:19,573
Yeech...

357
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,519
We are now Section D.

358
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:28,739
And I fucking beat them.

359
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,839
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.

360
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,999
There are elements within the state
who are prepared to kill.

361
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,100
We need to meet them unafraid.

362
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,280
Spoken like a true believer.

363
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,679
My superiors also ask why
the information on Jessie Eden

364
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,800
and the Communists
has apparently dried up.

365
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,480
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?

366
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,199
Your sister has an interesting theory.

367
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,520
She thinks perhaps at last

368
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:08,220
Tommy Shelby has actually started
to believe in something.

369
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:21,220
Younger.

370
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,879
Please don't listen
to my sister's opinions of me.

371
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,100
They are always... hopeful.

372
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,820
Therefore they are always wrong.

373
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,119
Can you hear me? Look at me.

374
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,239
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.

375
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,559
You'll be OK.

376
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,119
Look at me. Look at me.

377
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,400
It's OK.

378
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
Fuck!

379
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,319
Call an ambulance!

380
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,588
Call Moss!

381
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,759
Find out where I can reach Ada.
Come on, love.

382
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,359
Up you get. Good girl.

383
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,380
Come on, take her. Take her.

384
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:39,993
Come on. Up you get. Up you get.
Good boy.

385
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,319
Come on.

386
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,260
In you go. Inside. Stay inside.

387
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,700
Tommy?

388
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,519
Let's sit down, Ada.

389
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,840
What's happened?

390
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,180
Here, sit down, eh?

391
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:58,306
Ben Younger is dead.

392
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:03,166
Someone put a bomb in his car.

393
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:11,200
I don't know how you felt about him
or how bad this is going to hurt...

394
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,639
...but whatever happens,

395
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,040
just remember
you've a baby inside of you.

396
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,140
Oh, God.

397
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,940
Anyone you touch...

398
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,040
Which means anyone I touch.

399
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,320
Which means anyone any of us touch.

400
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,560
He never knew I was pregnant.

401
00:30:36,746 --> 00:30:38,306
I hadn't told him.

402
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,640
I didn't love him.

403
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,640
But I liked him.

404
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,600
He was decent and good...

405
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,120
I wasn't going to marry him.

406
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,500
The baby was a mistake, but that's OK.

407
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,360
I didn't ask anything of him.

408
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,779
God, he didn't deserve us.

409
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,479
Well, I've spoken to his family,

410
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,680
they're going to take care
of the funeral.

411
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,079
It will go down as an IRA assassination

412
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,958
of a British military officer.

413
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,060
And what was it really?

414
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,779
It was...

415
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,079
...a consequence of good intentions.

416
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,780
My good intentions.

417
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,719
I pushed him to report on the fascists.

418
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,840
I thought it was the right thing to do.

419
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,729
And as a result,

420
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:54,279
Section D, or the Branch, or Intelligence

421
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,720
had him killed.

422
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,879
There was a kid...

423
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,080
...died in the explosion.

424
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,960
He was ten years old.

425
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:19,239
It's funny...

426
00:32:20,346 --> 00:32:22,586
...isn't it, how it works?

427
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,920
Look, Tommy.

428
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,440
Don't give yourself this excuse.

429
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:37,939
He was ten years old.

430
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,399
If I'd have stuck to what I do,

431
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,320
he'd still be kicking a ball
in the street.

432
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,800
It's funny, isn't it?

433
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,880
Push the button.

434
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,000
Unlock the door and come home to me.

435
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,740
Chinese lanterns. Brass on deck.

436
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:21,779
God fucking help us.

437
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,079
Chang will be waiting
at the dock with the cargo.

438
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,800
We weigh it, we load it, we fuck off.

439
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,640
Where the fuck is Chang?

440
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
Isiah, take point.

441
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:28,546
Look lively.

442
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,639
Right, there's your lanterns.

443
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,159
Where the fuck are the Chinese?

444
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,199
All right, Charlie.

445
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,820
Arthur, it's Chang!

446
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
Christ!

447
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,807
Get over! Get over. Get over!

448
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,460
I knew we shouldn't trust these
fuckers and their fucking lanterns.

449
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,264
If it's the police, hold fire.

450
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,599
Chang, where's the stuff? Where is it?

451
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,519
They didn't look like police.
Smelt of gin.

452
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,639
They said they were taking the opium
on behalf of the King.

453
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,359
Then they saw your boat coming.

454
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,159
So, were they Italian?

455
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,719
- Were they Italian?
- Irish.

456
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,199
Irish, I think...

457
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,679
Oh, fuck.

458
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,879
Fuck! Charlie,

459
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,279
my gun. Give me the gun.

460
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,639
Give it up, that's it.

461
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,719
Listen. Listen to me.

462
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,799
They're Titanic boys out there, right?

463
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,479
They're out of Poplar.

464
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,039
In the war, they were very capable.

465
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,959
Very capable soldiers.

466
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,799
So was I.

467
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,360
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.

468
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,440
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!

469
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,519
Arthur! Arthur!

470
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,440
Stop firing! Arthur, they've gone.

471
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,559
To any of you still alive,

472
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,959
you do not fuck

473
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,520
with the Peaky fucking Blinders!

474
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,440
Huh!

475
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,040
Yeah.

476
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,560
Here we go.

477
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,840
Chang?

478
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,359
Purest ever in Europe.

479
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,639
Arthur?

480
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,039
There's a dead man in a copper's uniform.

481
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,640
Should I throw him in the cut?

482
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,359
No.

483
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,559
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?

484
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,840
Even Irishmen fucking float.

485
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,839
No, go and fire... go and fire the kilns.

486
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,760
But there are men working them.

487
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,799
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

488
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,440
And razor blades in your cap?

489
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,919
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

490
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,460
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

491
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,780
And if anybody speaks to you on that...

492
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,960
...you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

493
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,399
Right?

494
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
Yes, Arthur.

495
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,919
Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,999
Do we know the people
who tried to trick us?

497
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,319
The uncles will be mad.

498
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,039
Fuck your uncles.

499
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,540
And your aunts, your cousins,
all of them, right?

500
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,799
Curly! Load this up onto the boat.
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?

501
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,519
Get back to fucking civilisation

502
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,639
and find out who's been talking.

503
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,439
Yeah! Now look,

504
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,839
the Titanic heard about this, right?

505
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,240
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will want to be here.

506
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,519
Well, let 'em come, eh?

507
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,119
Let 'em come, Aberama.

508
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,559
Yeah.

509
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,639
Oh, let 'em fucking come!

510
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,640
Hat and coat off.

511
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,640
Stand up against the wall.

512
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,599
For your own safety, I need to search you

513
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,380
for items that could potentially
be used as weapons against you.

514
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,400
Oh, that's nice.

515
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,999
He was my friend.

516
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,479
Yeah, well,
he's nobody's friend any more.

517
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,759
He's a fucking animal.

518
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,540
Laces out of your shoes.

519
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,160
Table.

520
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,980
Barney? Visitor.

521
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,393
This one's real.

522
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,359
You can wait here.

523
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,500
No. I can't.

524
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,159
It's your funeral.

525
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,880
- I'll have to lock you in.
- Yeah.

526
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,400
Hello, Barney.

527
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,880
Arthur says to say hello.

528
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,480
Sergeant Major?

529
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,319
You're alive?

530
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,519
Arthur's alive, John's dead,

531
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,400
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead...

532
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,220
...Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.

533
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,760
Yeah.

534
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,040
And I'm alive.

535
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,180
Them as have gone are the lucky ones.

536
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,359
Thanks for the letters you send,
Sergeant Major.

537
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,220
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them.
I just... just sign them.

538
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,039
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?

539
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,879
No, they stick the pen up me arse.

540
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,880
Someone in here said your name.

541
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,359
They said out there
you are a politician now.

542
00:44:58,566 --> 00:45:00,126
Sometimes I am.

543
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,120
I didn't know if it was real, comrade.

544
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,279
I see rats coming out of bodies
like at the black wood.

545
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,560
The shit they give me in here...

546
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,080
Hey, Barney, look at me.

547
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,360
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.

548
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,559
It'll bring on a heart attack.

549
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,260
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.

550
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:44,513
So, here.

551
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:49,219
You're in here forever, brother.

552
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,746
You don't have the use
of your fucking hands.

553
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,400
You're still in the tunnels.

554
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,433
I can give this to you now.

555
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,660
Do you want it?

556
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,760
No.

557
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,160
Why not?

558
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,800
I know.

559
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,740
I know.

560
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,359
You still remember...

561
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,440
...that French waitress.

562
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,839
You still going on about that, Tom?

563
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,880
Yeah.

564
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,479
Did you fuck her before me? Whoever did

565
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,879
gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.

566
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,340
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.

567
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,279
She was beautiful. She was.

568
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,560
She was.

569
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,280
And I reckon
I was second best after Barney.

570
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,217
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?

571
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:18,980
You're in here, Barney,

572
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,720
you have no hands,
there is no daylight...

573
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,520
...and you don't want to die.

574
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,120
No, I don't.

575
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,200
Because one day things might change.

576
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:46,166
Yeah.

577
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,920
Things might change.

578
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,720
Maybe they already have.

579
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,140
Come here, Barney.

580
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,120
Come here.

581
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,080
What if I could break you out of here?

582
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,840
Why would you break me out?

583
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,119
See, the trouble with the people in here

584
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,800
is the fucking meds they keep you on.

585
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,799
Ten years since we were back,

586
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,940
Barney, ten fucking years.

587
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,119
Maybe the storm has passed.

588
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,800
Passed for you, then, has it, Tom?

589
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,079
What would the world do with me
if I was out?

590
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,400
I've a job for you.

591
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,199
Fuck!

592
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,400
Barney...

593
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,560
Barney, you were the best fucking
sniper in our company. Never missed.

594
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,920
I can use that man.

595
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:49,220
I'll get you the latest BSA,
fucking... telescopic sights.

596
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,439
Who am I shooting?

597
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,119
Fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off,

598
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,190
get you free.

599
00:48:56,191 --> 00:48:58,680
- Are you all right in there?
- Grand in here.

600
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,960
What do you say, Barney?

601
00:49:05,413 --> 00:49:07,013
I'll come for you...

602
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,639
...after midnight on Wednesday.

603
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,359
I don't keep track of days, Tom.

604
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,479
Don't have to.

605
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,440
You'll know it will be Wednesday,
cos there'll be a big fucking bang.

606
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,740
All right.

607
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,926
Big fucking bang.

608
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:26,799
Big fucking bang.

609
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,199
Big fucking bang.

610
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,140
It's fucking Wednesday!

611
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,159
Big bang on Wednesday!

612
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,159
They called from the Black Boy in Knowle.

613
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,760
They'll be here any minute.

614
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,840
I hear you agreed to give up the north.

615
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,060
I hear... there needs to be
some certainty in the south.

616
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,799
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic,

617
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,740
who've heard about a cargo.

618
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,439
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

619
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,780
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

620
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,799
Well, I would suggest

621
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,999
the most competent organiser
of men in the south...

622
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,592
...is Alfie Solomons.

623
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:13,104
He's dead.

624
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,400
And he's Jewish!

625
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,079
And I'd say as far
as our boss is concerned,

626
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,279
him being dead would be
less of an obstacle

627
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,520
than him being Jewish.

628
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,439
I think he'll give London
to the Italians.

629
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,400
He likes Italians.

630
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,199
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

631
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,060
but you're going to have to
accept it, tinker boy.

632
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,600
I like Wincanton.

633
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,360
It's a grand old racecourse.

634
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,959
And that brother of yours,

635
00:51:46,763 --> 00:51:48,640
the one who left me a hand grenade...

636
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,728
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end

637
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:56,260
and the whistle blew.

638
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:59,860
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.

639
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,119
We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.

640
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,199
Yeah, I heard.

641
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,240
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.

642
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,239
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

643
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,844
Your dad? Who's your dad?

644
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:18,840
This is my fucking dad.

645
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,959
Right here.

646
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,639
This is my fucking dad.

647
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,000
Where's Aberama?

648
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,239
He got off at Solihull.

649
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,400
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...

650
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,599
...he'll cut his fucking throat.

651
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,719
Tell the tinker

652
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,919
he's welcome to come and try it any time.

653
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,319
Mm.

654
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,740
Is it all aboard?

655
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,599
Yeah.

656
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:49,393
It's all there.

657
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,599
We weighed it at the wharf.

658
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,039
We used cockney scales.

659
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,120
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.

660
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,340
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?

661
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,479
Put ten sacks of flour

662
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,700
onto Mr McCavern's boat. Tom!

663
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,879
I-I don't think it's really flour.

664
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,279
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

665
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,679
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

666
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,840
Curly?

667
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,119
Hey, Arthur?

668
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,639
Someday, yes?

669
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,960
You and me.

670
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,719
Oh, Tommy, hey?

671
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,320
Fascists, hmm?

672
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,120
Look at 'em.

673
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,360
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.

674
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,100
But you...

675
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,420
You, Billy Boy...

676
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,599
Oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

677
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,100
I like yer.

678
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,479
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

679
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,639
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.

680
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,800
- Someday.
- Yeah.

681
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

682
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,040
You just tell me when, Tom.

683
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,560
You just tell me when.

684
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,079
So, er...

685
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,589
So you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?

686
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,740
Yeah.

687
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,680
Barney Thomason...

688
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,679
...is going to kill...

689
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,540
...Oswald Mosley,
shoot him in the fucking head.

690
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,240
Yep.

691
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,119
While he's on stage.

692
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,920
While I'm stood next to him.

693
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,320
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

694
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,020
...and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

695
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,160
I had more complicated strategies
in mind for Mr Mosley.

696
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,800
Then he spoke badly to my wife.

697
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,759
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

698
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,000
Yeah.
