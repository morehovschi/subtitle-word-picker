The first thing

Do you think you could
get away for a day?

429
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,468
I guess so.

430

00:19:40,189 --> 00:19:41,523
And then his keeper came.

00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:43,291

what kind of a ballplayer</i>

505
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,236
<i>you were</i> that<i> day.</i>

506
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:43,572
Well, isn't that what counts?

507
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,175
It's all that ought to count.

508
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:48,276
And maybe someday
it's all that will count.

509
00:22:48,277 --> 00:22:50,411
That's why we brought you here.

510
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,881
I want to see if we can make
a start in that direction.

511
00:22:53,882 --> 00:22:56,785
It'll take<i> a lot</i> of courage.

512
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:59,622
Yeah... it sure will.

513
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:00,956
It might take more courage

514
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,824
for the organization
than for you, Jackie.

515
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,160
Have you thought of that?

516
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:06,495
I haven't thought of anything.

517
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,330
It's all so sudden...

518
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:10,466
Kind of hits me
straight between the eyes.

519
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:12,167
Just relax, boy.

520
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,636
There's plenty of time.

521
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,938
Pull up a chair...
Make yourself comfortable.

522
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,440
Thanks.

523
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:21,676
We're tackling
something big here, Jackie.

524
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:25,581
If we fail, no one
will try again for 20 years.

525
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:27,082
But if we succeed...

526
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,650
If we succeed, Brooklyn
will win a pennant.

527
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,019
Yes, that too.

528
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,689
But we're dealing
with rights here...

529
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,824
The right of any American
to play baseball...

530
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,326
The American game.

531
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,394
Do you think
he's our boy, Clyde?

532
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,264
Well, he can run, he can hit,

533
00:23:42,265 --> 00:23:43,331
and he can field.

534
00:23:43,332 --> 00:23:45,433
But can he take it?

535
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,570
That, I don't know.

536
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,404
What do you think, Jackie?

537
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,605
Well, I can try.

538
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:51,939
Think you've got guts enough

539
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,074
to play the game no matter
what happens?

540
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,410
They'll shout insults at you.

541
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:57,012
They'll come
into you spikes first.

542
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:58,580
They'll throw at your head.

543
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,183
They've been throwin' at my head

544
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,784
for a long time, Mr. Rickey.

545
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,518
Suppose I'm a player
in the heat of a game.

546
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,388
I collide with you
at second base.

547
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:08,189
And when I get up, I say,

548
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,392
"You dirty black so-and-so!"

549
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:12,294
What do you do?

550
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,429
Mr. Rickey, do you
want a ballplayer

551
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,765
who's afraid to fight back?

552
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:17,900
I want a ballplayer
with guts enough

553
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,333
<i>not to</i> fight back.

554
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,737
You've got to do
this job with base hits,

555
00:24:21,738 --> 00:24:23,604
stolen bases, and fielding
ground balls, Jackie.

556
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:25,006
Nothing else.

557
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,342
I'm playin' against you
and I'm hotheaded.

558
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:28,945
I want to win this game.

559
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,545
I go into you spikes first.

560
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,413
You jab the ball in my ribs.

561
00:24:32,414 --> 00:24:33,480
The umpire says, "Out."

562
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,083
All I see is your face...

563
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,418
That black face over me.

564
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,286
So I haul off and punch you

565
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:39,388
right in the cheek.

566
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:41,556
What do you do?

567
00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:43,859
Mr. Rickey, I've got two cheeks.

568
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,331
Good!

569
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,766
You under contract
to the Black Panthers?

570
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,369
No, sir, we don't
have contracts.

571
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,704
Do you have any agreement

572
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,037
about how long you'll play?

573
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:57,372
No, sir, none at all.

574
00:24:57,373 --> 00:24:58,574
All right.

575
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,909
Clyde will give you
a contract before you leave.

576
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,244
Don't sign it right away.

577
00:25:02,245 --> 00:25:04,213
This is a<i> very</i> important move.

578
00:25:04,214 --> 00:25:06,681
Think it over carefully.

579
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,417
Is your, ah, mother living?

580
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:11,186
Yes, sir, she's in California.

581
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:13,987
Call her up... ask her advice.

582
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:15,323
We'll pay the phone bill.

583
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:16,324
Yes, sir.

584
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,927
And, Jackie...
remember one thing.

585
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:21,063
No matter what happens
on the ball field,

586
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:23,164
you can't fight back.

587
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,100
That's going
to be the hard part...

588
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,502
You can't fight back.

589
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,741
Helen, get
Jackie Robinson's home

Only...

627
00:26:46,516 --> 00:26:50,285
only there must be churches
in a big town like New York.

628
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:52,420
Why don't you
go find yourself a church

629
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:57,025
and talk to the minister
and see what he has to say.

Glad to know you, Mr. Robinson.

I need some advice...
Important advice.

641
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:32,227
Well, suppose we sit down

643
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,531
You're new to this part

644

of the city, Mr. Robinson?

645
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,100
I'm from California.

646
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,704
I came to New York yesterday

647
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:41,870
to see Branch Rickey.

648
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,103
Rickey?

649
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:44,706
Do you mean, uh...

650
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,541
Mr. Rickey, the baseball man?

651
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,443
Yes.

652
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,311
I'm a ballplayer, Reverend.

653
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,179
I've just learned
that the Brooklyn Dodgers

654
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,647
have been scouting Negro players

655
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,248
for a couple of years,

656
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,651
and Mr. Rickey thinks
I'm good enough to...

657
00:27:57,652 --> 00:27:59,520
Reverend, it means
that a colored man

658
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:01,922
will be able to play
on the same field

659
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:04,125
with a white man
for the first time.

660
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:06,795
Uh, who goes out
to these ball parks, Jackie?

661
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,263
Just white men?

662
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:11,033
No, anybody can buy
a ticket, Reverend.

663
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,801
Colored or white.

664
00:28:12,802 --> 00:28:15,103
Ah, tell me, Jackie.

665
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:17,839
What do you think
would<i> actually</i> happen

666
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,439
if you were to get out

667
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,478
on a white baseball field?

668
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:25,345
I don't know.

All right, Hank!

842
00:37:30,993 --> 00:37:33,128
This guy's got
a hole in his bat.

843
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:35,698

844

849

852
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:16,439
Knitting, knitting.

853
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:20,374

you ever do, Mrs. Robinson.

854
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,709
Why don't you walk downtown

855
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,077

856
00:38:23,078 --> 00:38:25,213
Or maybe take a
ride to the beach?

857
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:26,380

858

861

862
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,824

863

868
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:50,371
Maybe they don't usually...

but sometimes they do.

870
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,807
Some of the things they said

900
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:28,936
it is a fact that some cities

901

are expressing
pretty strong sentiments.

902
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:32,807
So strong, in fact, that I hear

903
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,709
the International League
president, Shaughnessy,

Well, go ahead and talk.

912

Now suppose you
let me decide that.

918
00:41:08,143 --> 00:41:10,179
You'll break up
the whole International League

919

playing that colored boy.

920
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:14,014
I've had letters, phone calls...

921
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,983
I've even polled
all the sportswriters.

922
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:17,853
What do the sportswriters
have to say?

923

Jim Flanagan thinks you're
even hurting the Negroes.

924
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,257
This'll stir up
a lot of trouble.

925
00:41:22,258 --> 00:41:23,858
There'll be black

you ever started it.

928
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,166
Frank, I've spent
my whole life in baseball,

929
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,034
and I've always
been proud of that,

930
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:34,635
because I've always
thought baseball

931
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:36,505
was a fine game, a clean game.

932
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,639
I've always thought
it had a good influence

933
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,041
on the American people,
on the kids growing up.

934
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,175
I've always thought baseball

935
00:41:42,176 --> 00:41:44,144
taught fair play
and sportsmanship.

936

But if what you say is true,

937

But a sad one for Jersey.

1043
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,430
There's two out in the ninth,

1044
00:48:43,431 --> 00:48:45,633
and the score is 14 to 1

1045

City put-out left.

to Robinson's left!

1049

But he stabs it!

1050

Jackie goes
to first for the out,

1051

and for the president
of the Brooklyn Dodgers,

1055

Branch Rickey.

1056

two stolen bases,

1061

1309

01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:37,910
Mr. Rickey,
I... wasn't thinkin'.

1328
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:39,579
I didn't think.

1329
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:40,914
And that, sir, explains why

1330
01:00:40,915 --> 01:00:43,418
your teammates
call you "Ironhead."

1331
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,021
Yes, sir.

1332
01:00:48,455 --> 01:00:51,324
Karpen, you've been
in baseball a long time.

1333
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:54,193
Do you want to play
on the Dodgers with Robinson?

1334
01:00:54,194 --> 01:00:55,760
No, sir, I don't.

1335
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:59,231
<i>Will you</i> play with Robinson?

1336
01:00:59,232 --> 01:01:00,767
I'd rather not, sir.

1337
01:01:00,768 --> 01:01:02,635
Would you like
to have your contract

1338
01:01:02,636 --> 01:01:04,438
transferred to another club?

1339
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:05,805
Yes, sir, I would.

1340
01:01:05,806 --> 01:01:09,142
I<i> may</i> accommodate you, sir.

1341
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:10,644
All right, men.

1342
01:01:10,645 --> 01:01:13,412
I respect your right
to petition.

1343
01:01:13,413 --> 01:01:15,648
But I do question
and I will fight

1344
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,483
any petition
that denies any American

1345
01:01:17,484 --> 01:01:19,084
the right to earn his living

1346
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,220
in a game that is
supposed to represent

1347
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:24,057
the democratic principles
of sportsmanship and fair play!

1348
01:01:24,058 --> 01:01:25,892
Do you understand me?!

1349
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:27,862
<i>- (Tony) Yes, sir.
- (Dalby) Yes, sir.</i>

1350
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:29,863
That's all for tonight.

1351
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:36,568
Your suits are in your lockers.

1352
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,073
There's a ball game tomorrow.

1353
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:43,443
I hope I'll see you there...

1354
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,446
in uniform.

1355
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:59,460
Jackie.

1356
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:01,694
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1357
01:02:01,695 --> 01:02:02,762
Jackie, Montreal is starting

1358
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:05,231
a 12-game series
with the Dodgers.

1359
01:02:05,232 --> 01:02:06,233
Yes, sir.

1360
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:07,234
Take this.

1361
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:08,834
During that series I want you

1362
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,137
to play first base for Montreal.

1363
01:02:11,138 --> 01:02:12,637
First base?

1364
01:02:12,638 --> 01:02:14,506
Mr. Rickey, I've never
played first base.

1365
01:02:14,507 --> 01:02:16,209
We're protected
at second base, Jackie.

1366
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,311
We've got Burwell.

1367
01:02:18,312 --> 01:02:20,912
Brooklyn can use
a good first baseman.

1368
01:02:20,913 --> 01:02:22,914
Oh, I see.

1369
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,517
Go out there and show 'em.

1370
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:25,952
Run their legs off.

1371
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:27,253
Yes, sir!

1372
01:02:27,254 --> 01:02:29,188
I sure will!

1373
01:02:29,189 --> 01:02:32,192

<i>Get him out of there!</i>

1379
01:02:46,906 --> 01:02:49,242
Make him pitch to ya.

1380
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:50,642

1383
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,853

01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,929
All right, Lefty, come on, boy.

1387
01:03:09,297 --> 01:03:10,798
Whack!

1388

<i>(umpire) You're out!</i>

1390
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:21,108
Yeah, but a little dangerous.

1391
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:22,441
I think I'll move over

1392
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:24,444
to the Brooklyn side.

1393
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:29,650
<i>(Rickey) Karpen.</i>

1394
01:03:30,817 --> 01:03:32,151
You wanted to keep Robinson

1395
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:33,552
off the Brooklyn team?

1396
01:03:33,553 --> 01:03:34,388
Yes, sir.

1397
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:36,255
Then why do you keep feeding him

1398
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:37,324
those big fat ones?

1399
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:39,191
I ain't feedin' him no fat ones.

1400
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,327
Then how'd he get
three hits off you?

1401
01:03:41,328 --> 01:03:42,394
Just lucky.

1402
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:43,528
All right, Karpen.

1403
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,130
He's up first in this inning.

1404
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:47,534
If you want to keep him
off the team,

1405
01:03:47,535 --> 01:03:49,670
I'll tell you how you can do it.

1406
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:50,671
Strike him out.

1407
01:03:50,672 --> 01:03:52,672
Okay, watch me.

Hey, Barney... win this game

<i>why don't you go back

<i>Why don't you
drop dead, Robinson?</i>

1426
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,432
Greetings from Ebbets Field.

1427
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,867
They call it big league
baseball, folks,

1428
01:04:54,868 --> 01:04:56,468
because you've got to be bigger

1429
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:58,271
and better to stay up here.

1430
01:04:58,272 --> 01:05:00,106
That's the problem
confronting Jackie Robinson

1431
01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:02,508
at this very minute
as he goes to bat

1432
01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:04,910
for the first time
in a big league game.

1433
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:07,579
Oh, yes, I know he's done
all right in training...

1434
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,481
I've seen the papers too.

1435
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:11,217
But that was only practice.

1436
01:05:11,218 --> 01:05:14,352
From now on, it's for keeps.

1437
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:16,755
There's a little man
upstairs in the press box

1438
01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:18,657
who's known among other things

1439
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:20,492
as the official scorer.

1440
01:05:20,493 --> 01:05:22,295
He watches like a hawk.

1441
01:05:22,296 --> 01:05:24,329
He marks down everything.

1442
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,199
He'll make a mark for every move

1443
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,434
that Jackie Robinson makes...

1444
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,302
Good or bad.

1445
01:05:29,303 --> 01:05:31,170
And not only
the official scorer's eyes

1446
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:32,505
are on the Negro rookie...

1447
01:05:32,506 --> 01:05:34,372
the whole world is waiting.

1448
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:35,874
Everybody wants to know

1449
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:38,343
if Branch Rickey
has made a mistake.

1450
01:05:38,344 --> 01:05:41,880
Will they be able to say
"I told you so"?

1451
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:43,884
Let's see.

1452
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,142
Whack!

1453
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:17,483
<i>Down, Jack!</i>

1454
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:19,418
Safe!

1455
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:22,088
He made it! He made it!

1456
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:23,157
He got a triple!

1457
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:24,356
So what?

1458
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:25,958
What do you mean "so what?"

1459
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:28,193
Sit down.

1460
01:06:45,678 --> 01:06:46,679
Ooh!

1461
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,814
You'll lose your
tightness in a few days.

1462
01:06:48,815 --> 01:06:50,083
It's nerves, that's all.

1463
01:06:50,084 --> 01:06:52,851
I just can't get on
to shifting my feet.

1464
01:06:52,852 --> 01:06:54,452
I missed the bag
completely today

1465
01:06:54,453 --> 01:06:55,521
in the third inning.

1466
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:57,824
If they'd only let you
play second base.

1467
01:06:57,825 --> 01:07:00,059
We've got Burwell
at second base.

1468
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,660
First is where they need me.

1469
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:04,063
If you can't get it
and it worries you...

1470
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:05,298
It's got me worried.

1471
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:07,534
And it's got me where
I'm not hitting, either.

1472
01:07:07,535 --> 01:07:09,336
You're still
their best base runner.

1473
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:11,204
They can't take
that away from you.

1474
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:13,439
Yeah, but you can't steal first.

1475
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,641
Owww!

1476
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:16,242
What've you got in those hands?

1477
01:07:16,243 --> 01:07:17,242
Steel springs?

1478
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,010
They're nurse's hands, remember?

1479
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:21,146
They'd better nurse me
out of this slump,

1480
01:07:21,147 --> 01:07:24,751
or Mr. Rickey will be
lookin' for a new boy.

1481
01:07:27,386 --> 01:07:28,720
Don't wait till you feel

1482
01:07:28,721 --> 01:07:30,055
the bag under your foot.

1483
01:07:30,056 --> 01:07:31,657
Do it all in one motion.

1484
01:07:31,658 --> 01:07:33,793
I just can't get the hang of it.

1485
01:07:33,794 --> 01:07:35,296
Try another one.

1486
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,465
That's worse.

1487
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:43,602
<i>(player) Here, let
me show you how.</i>

1488
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:45,204
You almost had it last time.

1489
01:07:45,205 --> 01:07:46,539
When you miss the bag,

1490
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,675
you kick back for it like this.

1491
01:07:49,676 --> 01:07:51,142
Here, you try it.

1492
01:07:51,143 --> 01:07:52,677
Thanks.

1493
01:07:58,051 --> 01:07:59,052
That's the idea.

1494
01:07:59,053 --> 01:08:02,455
All you have to do
is practice now.

1495

Why'd he want to do that?

1496

If I can't make
the grade at first base,

1497
01:08:09,062 --> 01:08:11,196
he'd have his old job back.

1498
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:13,700
He's a team player, Jackie.

1499
01:08:24,178 --> 01:08:27,612
Yeah, and the weatherman
apologizes for the recent rain.

1500
01:08:27,613 --> 01:08:29,348
Well, let's get serious, folks.

1501
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:30,950
They can't say
that Branch Rickey

1502
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,852
hasn't given Jackie Robinson

1503
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:34,586
a king-sized opportunity

1504
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:36,923
in staying
in big league baseball.

1505
01:08:36,924 --> 01:08:38,624
On that last road trip,

1506
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,027
when the California boy
wasn't hitting too well,

1507
01:08:41,028 --> 01:08:42,896
some of the
out-of-town sportswriters

1508
01:08:42,897 --> 01:08:45,296
said that Jackie
should have been out of there.

1509
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:47,433
He had a little trouble
with first base...

1510
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:49,302
Playing it and reaching it.

1511
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:52,506
He just couldn't come up
with that extra base hit.

1512
01:08:52,507 --> 01:08:55,107
Right now, I see Jackie
stepping into the box.

1513
01:08:56,777 --> 01:08:59,911
All right, bring it in
out there.

1514
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:00,915
Here we go!

1515
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:02,915
Ball!

1516
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:04,417
Come on, babe.

1517
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:07,588
All right, let's go.

1518
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:09,090
Here it is.

1519
01:09:10,991 --> 01:09:12,224
Whack!

1520
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:14,125
Thattaboy, Jackie.

1521
01:09:14,126 --> 01:09:15,827
What happened to you?!

1522
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,036
Keep your
fingers crossed, folks.

1523
01:09:25,037 --> 01:09:27,173
It may be that the rookie,
Jackie Robinson,

1524
01:09:27,174 --> 01:09:29,675
is a big league
ballplayer after all.

1525
01:09:29,676 --> 01:09:31,811
But he had us
all worried, didn't he?

1526
01:09:31,812 --> 01:09:34,481
Going to the plate 19
straight times without a hit.

1527
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:36,350
But the pendulum
can swing both ways,

1528
01:09:36,351 --> 01:09:38,483
and it may be
that Jackie has started

1529
01:09:38,484 --> 01:09:39,817
on a hitting streak now.

1530
01:09:39,818 --> 01:09:42,388
In baseball, it's not
<i>who</i> or what you are,

1531
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:45,057
but can you play the game?

1532
01:09:45,058 --> 01:09:48,062
And Jackie Robinson
sure is playing it.

1533
01:09:49,964 --> 01:09:50,964
Whack!

1534
01:09:53,867 --> 01:09:56,067
Well, Dalby, he's hitting again.

1535
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:59,072
Yeah, we might win
the pennant now.

1536
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:05,045
Whack!

1537
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:12,051

You're out of the game, Kelly!

1539
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:20,861
He knocked me down!

1540
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,565
Didn't you spike the
Cub shortstop last week?

1541
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:26,631
That was an accident.

1542
01:10:26,632 --> 01:10:27,967
So was this an accident.

1543
01:10:27,968 --> 01:10:29,567
