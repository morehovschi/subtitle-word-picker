00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,450
This place is under
new management...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,470
by order of the Peaky Blinders.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,270
Just write down, "Peace
between the Jews and the Italians."

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,360
And war...

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,590
.. against the Gypsies.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,430
'I love him, Tom.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,590
'I know.'

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,710
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,230
and put him charge of the new.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,110
Some idiots at The Marquis Of Lorne.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,110
They tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,430
We fought them off.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,520
The Marquis, eh?

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,310
What do we want with
a 1,000 guinea horse?

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,710
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,670
a good racehorse is a passport
to the owners' enclosure.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

18

'I have made arrangements
with men I trust.'

If I should die...

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,480
then you will die.

Just do your duty!

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,150
Dear Lord,
for what we are about to receive,

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,510
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

Amen.

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,310
The Passover started off
way out there in the Far East -

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,230
out in the sand, out in the desert,

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,670
where my forefathers come from -

55
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,910
the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

56
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,030
It started out as
a little speck on the horizon...

57
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,510
Arthur, this ain't right!

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,350
Billy, don't worry, mate.
If you want, you can leave.

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,830
If you need to go to the little
boy's room, you can leave.

60
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,830
~ We're going to open them in a minute
anyway. ~ He's all right. Billy Boy.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,630
~ Do you want to leave?
~ No, you are all right.

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,150
~ You want to stay? ~ I'll stay.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,830
You stay there, then, treacle. OK.

64
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,670
So, the Pharaoh,
have you heard of him?

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,350
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,230
for thousands and thousands
of years.

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,750
Persecuted race.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,150
He did, he persecuted my race.
The killing of the innocent, right?

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,830
Seder, this feast what we is
having here, right?

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,630
Seder is basically the day when
the Jewish angels decided, you know,

71
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,910
that the evil fucking Egyptians
had pushed their fucking luck.

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,190
~ Right. ~ It's part of our tradition,
to do with Seder, right,

73
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,040
that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king...

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,670
.. we have to carry out
the Korban Pesach.

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,190
~ Right. ~ That is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,350
~ It's a goat! ~ Yeah,
and we are going to sacrifice it.

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,590
Tonight.

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,550
That is part of the reason why
we have to shut the doors as well.

79
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,830
But this year we thought we'd give
the fucking goat a name.

80
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,470
~ You've named it?
~ We fucking did. Yeah.

81
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,790
They named the fucking goat.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,630
After the evil fucking
Egyptian pharaoh.

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,710
The fucking enemy!

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,510
That's right!
You know what we called him?

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,670
What did you call him?

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
Tommy Shelby.

87
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,590
Police! Stay where you are.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,590
You're all fired.

89
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,350
Fuck you!

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,880
That's right,
let's take the load off.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,830
So, then the evil Egyptian scum

92
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,190
was finally cleansed

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,480
by the blood of the Passover goat.

94
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,920
That's from Sabini.

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,950
You tell your Gypsy king...

96
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,710
.. that whoever comes down south

97
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,560
shall return north
in many fucking pieces.

98
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,350
The fucking animal.
He come in here, right,

99
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,350
with a fucking gun and a razor,
he shot him in the face.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,590
My lads, they restrained him.
Look at him. He is dead.

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,910
Is he dead?

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,390
He is fucking dead!

103
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,320
He wants arresting or some thing,
right? Surely.

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,310
Not again! Michael!
No, you can't take him away again!

105
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,830
You can't take my son away!

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,310
~ Give me the boy. ~ Come back here.

107
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,950
Listen, we are arresting him
for taking part in a fight...

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,910
Ow, you...!

109
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,990
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,990
Don't say anything.
Tommy will get you out.

111
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
I'll be all right...

112
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
You should know that, as of this
night, Tommy Shelby is finished.

113
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,040
Mick, this is Thomas Shelby.
He's come to check up on his filly.

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,320
Yes. I've heard about him.

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,150
Micky is the best horseman
in England.

116
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,230
He likes to waste money,
I know that.

117
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,230
According to the reports
I've been given

118
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,470
you're spending £2 a month
on worming powder.

119
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,350
What? You want a horse with worms?

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,310
Horses get worms
from the water trough.

121
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,790
If you put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

122
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,120
Goldfish?

123
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,270
That'll be a Gypsy thing, is it?

124
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,830
No, it's an accounting thing.

125
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,710
Goldfish cost a penny each.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
Or you can win them at the fair.

127
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,870
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether.

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,120
Excuse me.

129
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,520
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,270
Hello, hello. How are you, eh?

131
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,830
Goldfish? Seriously?

132
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,160
Yep. You people have a lot to learn.

133
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,640
They asked me if I wanted
a fire in the guest bedroom.

134
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
I said no.

135
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,040
Just one fire tonight.

136
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,870
Bold and fearless, eh?

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Yes.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,640
Though I'm not really fearless.

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,720
~ Drink? ~ Why not?

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,630
Madam, there is a telephone call.

141
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,550
I'll take it in the drawing room.

142
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,960
It's for Mr Shelby.

143
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,160
We had a deal.

144
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,350
Hey?

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
We had a fucking deal!

146
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,710
I would thank you to moderate your
language in a place of worship.

147
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
We had a fucking deal.

148
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
Mr Shelby.

149
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,710
If you read the papers, you might
have seen that the Home Secretary

150
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,150
has got himself into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

151
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,670
Prostitution, protection,

152
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,390
racketeering, drinking,

153
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,510
cocaine and, of course...

154
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,920
gambling.

155
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,950
He has demanded results.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,030
You offered me protection.
You promised me protection.

157
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,640
Well, no, you see it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

158
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,680
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

159
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,670
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

160
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,230
decides to go on some sort of
blood orgy during dinner.

161
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,710
Don't fucking lie to me!

162
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,680
Do not sit here in your
fucking church and lie to me!

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,470
You will need to
contain your emotions

164
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,680
or this meeting is at an end.

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,320
Good.

166
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,080
That's better.

167
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,560
So...

168
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,470
.. let us review the new situation.

169
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,910
I have your brother
in a prison cell

170
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,630
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

171
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,830
The case against him is strong

172
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,160
and I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

173
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,950
And then there is Polly's son,
Michael.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,920
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis pub.

175
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,670
He was a tough nut to crack,
that boy, but crack he did.

176
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,870
So I have your brother
facing the noose,

177
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,510
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

178
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,150
And I have your entire organisation
in disarray

179
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,750
in Birmingham and in London.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,960
What do you want?

181
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,240
What do I want?!

182
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,320
I don't understand.

183
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,560
I have already agreed to
do your fucking killing for you.

184
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Now, what is it you want from me?

185
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,440
There you go, you see.

186
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,640
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

187
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,030
You see, I found...
I wasn't sleeping so well.

188
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,870
It wasn't just the smell
and the noise in that room, no.

189
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,240
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge...

190
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,680
The knowledge that...

191
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,400
.. Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

192
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,840
Therefore...

193
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,510
.. the threat to your own life
might not be enough

194
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,960
to make it certain that you will
obey me on the given day.

195
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,230
I needed also the power of life
and death over your family.

196
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,710
And that I now have.

197
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,830
Your brother.

198
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,470
Your cousin.

199
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,800
And your sister.

200
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,950
I have known her address in Primrose
Hill since the day she moved in.

201
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,790
She is safe
only as long as I want her to be.

202
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,680
I have been ahead of you...

203
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,360
.. every step of the way.

204
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,280
And, as my father used to say...

205
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,710
.. to make sure your dog obeys you,

206
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
you have to show it the stick
once in a while.

207
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,470
Tommy, Arthur is in
solitary confinement.

208
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,190
Michael is in the remand wing of...

209
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,160
I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

210
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,520
'Tommy?

211
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,360
'It's me.'

212
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
Tommy, can you hear me?

213
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,430
Yes, er, Grace.

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,640
I think you called.
I... haven't slept.

215
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,750
Grace, this is not a good time.

216
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,590
I can call you back.

217
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,280
~ No, it's fine. It's all right.
~ Can we meet?

218
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,750
Yes. We'll meet.

219
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,960
When?

220
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,320
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

221
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,440
John?

222
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,510
The coppers have lifted
ten of our men in Camden Town,

223
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,270
the rest of them are on the run.

224
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,110
~ They've taken Michael.
~ Business first.

225
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,350
~ They took Michael last night.
~ I said business first.

226
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,390
~ They picked him up...
~ Polly, business first!

227
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,790
John?

228
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,430
They took all our whisky,

229
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,750
so no doubt they'll be
supping that for Christmas.

230
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,520
They've impounded all our vans,
put their own locks on the warehouse.

231
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,950
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
and handed back to
Sabini and Solomons.

233
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,350
The Black Country boys
think it was Arthur killed Billy

234
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,430
because that's what
the coppers told them.

235
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,430
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

236
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,510
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

237
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,470
I don't give a fuck
about Billy Kitchen.

238
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,430
I want my son out of prison. Now.

239
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,870
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

240
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,470
This meeting should just be family.

241
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,590
~ I can help. ~ It's family only, she is
not blood, Tommy! ~ Let her speak.

242
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,480
Or is this a business...?
Have you forgotten...?

243
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,550
Enough, Polly.

244
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Esme?

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,270
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

246
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,390
~ The bloody Lees!
~ They can give us men!

247
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,470
We don't need more fucking men!

248
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,030
It's men that have done the damage!

249
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,870
It... It is men
fighting like cockerels

250
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,640
that have put us
here in the first place.

251
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,120
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

252
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,310
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

253
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,870
I am taking him away
from this family.

254
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,440
For good.

255
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,600
This life is bad.

256
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,110
This life is all bad.

257
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,320
~ Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
~ Shut up and walk.

258
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,960
Thomas?

259
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,000
Should I go and speak to
Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,150
Yes.

261
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,590
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

262
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,720
Mm, good.

263
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,080
John, go and bring up the car.

264
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,470
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

265
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,030
Living the real life, you know?

266
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,640
Your Gypsy half is the stronger.

267
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,760
You just want to ride away.

268
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,830
France is the new place
for us, they say.

269
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,920
Lot of metal lying around still.

270
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,720
Guns and trucks and spent shells
and things.

271
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
Then you go south.

272
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,030
Saintes-Maries,
where the Black Madonna is.

273
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,480
My brothers go sometimes
for the fair.

274
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,920
It's like a home for us.

275
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
They still let you get lost there.

276
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
I've been to France, Esme.

277
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
So has John.

278
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,150
Now get your coat

279
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,080
and go with your husband.

280
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,950
And if you ever talk about
getting lost again,

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,040
I will cut you...

282
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
.. from this family.

283
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,440
What family?

284
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,190
Come in.

285
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
Ah, Polly.

286
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
Come to see my son.

287
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
Close the door.

288
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,750
I've just been conducting...

289
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,350
an interrogation.

290
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,030
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

291
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,950
My son, Michael, where is he?

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Do you think I need a shave?

293
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,270
It's been a long day.

294
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,200
I need to shave, don't you think?

295
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,400
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

296
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,670
Your son has been having a
hard time of it, I am told.

297
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,350
And that is why I thought that
you and I, together,

298
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,800
we should do whatever
we can to get him freed.

299
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,790
I... I have a form here,
a release form,

300
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,360
and with my signature he can be
freed by tomorrow morning at dawn.

301
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,760
So sign it.

302
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,870
He didn't do anything.

303
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,670
"Sign it, Mr Campbell,
please, sir."

304
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,080
Something like that, that'd be
a way to say it, wouldn't it?

305
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,160
Now...

306
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
.. what would prompt me to
do you such a favour, hmm?

307
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,680
What do you want?

308
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,750
Information?

309
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,200
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

310
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,350
With respect,

311
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,790
I would say that I know more about
Tommy's dealings than you do.

312
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,830
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business, for instance,

313
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,390
does he? No.

314
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,190
So, no...

315
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,960
it's not information I need.

316
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,720
What else could you give me...

317
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,160
.. in return for my signature?

318
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,840
I'm talking about a
simple transaction here.

319
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
I have a great curiosity.

320
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,520
Like a magpie... sees something...

321
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,920
.. something shining in the mud.

322
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,080
Oh, he has no need for
the silver, but...

323
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,160
.. but he takes it anyway.

324
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,390
Sign the form.

325
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,950
"Please, sir..."

326
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Please, sir...

327
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,550
I will sign that form
with this hand...

328
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,670
.. when I am finished.

329
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,470
It's a deal?

330
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,200
It's a deal.

331
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,990
You don't cry?

332
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,640
~ Oh, I can cry.
~ So...

333
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,440
.. that is what I want.

334
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,480
I need you to cry.

335
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,680
I will try.

336
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,630
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell,
sir. And I will do anything...

337
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,190
"Anything in return."

338
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,120
That's what you might have said, hmm?

339
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,680
I felt something when...

340
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,750
.. when I had you up against that car
and you felt it, too.

341
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,110
(Don't tell me you didn't, Polly.)

342
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,030
Because...

343
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,000
Oh, and now you think you're...

344
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,350
.. sort of respectable...

345
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,070
with your son and your house

346
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,990
and your maid,
but I know what you are,

347
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,160
you Gypsy Fenian slut.

348
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,040
Do you want it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

349
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,190
Now you cry.

350
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,040
You cry!

351
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,600
Get out. Get out.

352
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,310
Get out!

353
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,510
No. No!

354
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,830
I want him free.

355
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,840
I will get him free.

356
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,280
You don't need to shave.

357
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,880
You don't need to do anything.

358
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,790
Victory's just doing nothing,
as well.

359
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,640
Doing it soft and gentle.

360
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,440
Should I talk or not talk?

361
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,240
Should it be like
I am weak and small, yes?

362
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
Do you want me to talk or not talk?

363
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,270
Talk.

364
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,120
You're small and weak.

365
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,350
Then that is what I am -

366
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,120
small and weak.

367
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,280
Look.

368
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,400
Feel.

369
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,600
You made me cry.

370
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,190
No!

371
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,110
We had an agreement, right?

372
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,840
Yes. Yes!

373
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,790
Where've you been?

374
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,600
I went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth
for a glass or two of rum.

375
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,990
Was it one glass or two?

376
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,310
It was three.

377
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,030
Where's the baby?

378
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,680
Sleeping.

379
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,880
More like five.

380
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,840
It was more like six.

381
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,990
Did you meet the maid?

382
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,400
I talked politics with her
and she got bored and went to bed.

383
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,630
I phoned James.

384
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,950
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

385
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,640
He said he'd take Arthur's case
for free, so we don't need Tommy.

386
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,950
Pol?

387
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,590
We'll get Michael free, as well,
I promise.

388
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,760
There's no need, they're
letting him out in the morning.

389
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,230
If the baby wants anything at
night, ring the bell by the bed.

390
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,760
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl, she's getting lazy.

391
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,200
Well...

392
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
.. take advantage if you're nice.

What are you doing, Tommy?

00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,760
Shovelling shit, Curly.
Just like you.

And why are you doing that, Tommy?

416
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,320

if I wasn't who I am.

I think Tommy's lost his mind,
Charlie!

Well, it's honest work, Curly...

but I don't want to get used to it,

422
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,270
so I'll need six cans of petrol.

423
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,120
Bring them to the garage,
put them in the back of the car.

424
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,200
Six cans?

425
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,720
Tommy, if you ever want a job,

I have to be perfect.

She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

438
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,070
So what time will you be back?

439
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,440
Before midnight.

440
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
I'll be awake.

441
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,550
Is this your house?

442
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,840
Yes. Have a seat.

443
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,310
Do I not get a drink?

444
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,840
Please.

445
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,230
~ You want one? ~ Yes.

446
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
Still whisky?

447
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,910
Yes.

448
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,590
But other things have changed.

449
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,670
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

450
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,520
Yes, some things have changed.

451
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,110
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight...

452
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,280
I lit a fire in the
bedroom upstairs.

453
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,510
My plan was that we sit here for
a while and...

454
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,510
talk about old times,

455
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
drink some whisky.

456
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,190
And I was going to tell you

457
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,350
I hadn't spent a day
without thinking about you.

458
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,550
And then we were going
to go upstairs

459
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,880
and sleep together.

460
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,190
But just now,
on the way to opening the door,

461
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,760
I changed my mind.

462
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,430
So just have one drink,

463
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,590
tell me how happy you are in
New York and then you can go.

464
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,950
You "changed your mind"?

465
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,640
Mmm. So you can go.

466
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,390
As a matter of fact,
I am happy in New York.

467
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,790
~ And I am married.
~ Oh, yeah, he's rich, I know.

468
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,910
And he's sweet and he's kind to me,

469
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,110
so what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

470
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,350
after one whisky and
some conversation?

471
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,390
~ I was accounting for three whiskies.
~ How dare you?

472
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,750
Doesn't matter now,
because I've changed my mind.

473
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,390
I came here because you asked me.

474
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,430
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

475
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,110
~ And now I feel like an idiot.
~ Well, then go.

476
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
(Jesus.)

477
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,120
But you're still here.

478
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,590
Are you so certain?

479
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,560
That you're still in love with me?

480
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,520
I was, but I'm not any more.

481
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,310
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

482
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,790
No, I'm not armed.

483
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,280
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

484
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,350
You don't have a
sense of humour any more, either.

485
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,200
What are you talking about?

486
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,910
Thing is, I hate reunions.

487
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,670
I didn't want to sit here for
hours talking about nothing

488
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,320
and dancing around what
we really want to say.

489
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,710
So now...

490
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,270
I know you're happy in New York.
I know your husband's rich

491
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,750
and sweet and kind to you.
I know you're unarmed

492
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,670
and you didn't come here for sex,
because you don't love me any more.

493
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,550
And it's only three minutes past.

494
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,400
Another drink?

495
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,880
I'll take that as a yes.

496
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,960
It's good to see you, Grace.

497
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,760
So you didn't light the fire?

498
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,200
You see, my real plan...

499
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,840
.. was that we go out.

500
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,830
I want to impress you.

501
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
Now...

502
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,720
.. do you like Charlie Chaplin?

503
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,710
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

504
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,630
Good.

505
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
But I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

506
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,430
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

507
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,990
~ I am.
~ This isn't a picture house.

508
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,670
No, it's not a picture house.

509
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,750
So how will I see Charlie Chaplin?

510
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,870
You will see him and you will
hear him, just like I promised.

511
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,030
~ There you go, there's Chaplin.
~ Oh, my God, that's him. ~ Mm-hm.

512
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,630
~ That's really Charlie Chaplin
in person. ~ Yep.

513
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,990
He's in England, promoting his film.

514
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,630
~ And how the hell do you know
Charlie Chaplin? ~ I don't,

515
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,110
I know his bodyguard,
Wag MacDonald.

516
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,790
It's that chap there.

517
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,030
I was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

518
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,230
You see, Wag is also a
Romany Gypsy, as is Chaplin.

519
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,150
But he keeps it a secret.

520
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,030
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a Gypsy camp in Birmingham.

521
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,030
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

522
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
Thank you.

523
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,950
Thank you.

524
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,350
See, we've all got secrets, Grace.

525
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,280
Come on, I'll introduce you.

526
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,070
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

527
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

528
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,470
~ Hello. ~ Hello, Mr Campbell.

529
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,350
You said you knew my sister's
address in Primrose Hill.

530
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,710
So I expect you have men
watching the house,

531
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,030
to see who comes and goes.

532
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,790
Well, tonight, your men will see
me return to the house

533
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,670
with a very beautiful woman.

534
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,910
She will stay until
just before midnight.

535
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Course, I'll close the curtains.

536
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,360
Can you guess who the woman is?

537
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,550
Liar!

538
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,360
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

539
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,360
Tommy.

540
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,000
Tommy, do you have someone?

541
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,030
(It's too late, Tommy.)

542
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,950
(It's 11, Grace.)

543
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,960
I mean, it's too late.

544
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,750
If you'd come with me to New York...

545
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,320
I had things to do.

546
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,630
You mean the coin landed
the wrong way?

547
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,840
It couldn't have worked.

548
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,600
That was a question.

549
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,360
(Tommy, do you have someone?)

550
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,760
(I have a race horse.)

551
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,670
She's going to win the Derby.

552

When do you sail back?

566
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,360
We don't know yet.

567
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,080
You don't have a return ticket?

568
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,760
This wasn't right, Tommy.

569
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,720
When do you go back, Grace?

570
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,950
They're doing tests on us.

571
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,080
I don't
know when they'll be finished.

572
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,520
We're having treatment.

573
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,280
A doctor in Harley Street.

574
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,360
Some new thing. A breakthrough.

575
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,360
We're trying for a baby.

576
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,720
Why did you come here tonight?

577
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,160
The doctor believes it's surely me
who's at fault.

578
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,240
~ I am sorry. It is no-one's fault.
~ I'm tired of that.

579
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,760
Can I see you again?

580
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,240
Grace?

581
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,440
You're used to working under
cover, eh?

582
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,000
I've never lied to him once.

583
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,600
So tell him the truth.

584
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,640
Put your arms up.

585
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,040
What have we got here then?

586
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,720
Take your fucking hands off me!

587
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,560
Here he is. The King of London Town.

588
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,190
You been enjoying yourself?

589
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,470
Oh, yes, fucking great.

590
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,270
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

591
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,080
Rats everywhere.

592
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,360
Fucking cockneys.

593
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,590
Well, at least you're going to get
what you've always wanted.

594
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,710
~ And what's that?
~ You've tried to hang yourself twice.

595
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,840
Now the King's going to
do it for you.

596
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,560
~ I've been a fucking idiot. ~ Yeah.

597
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,350
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

598
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,470
Are you fucking repenting or
something?

599
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,560
Drawing.

600
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,230
I used to be good at drawing.

601
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,590
Arthur, please. For God's sake.
I don't need this.

602
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,310
I should have listened
more in class...

603
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,760
What fucking class?
You were never there!

604
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,830
I used to draw horses.

605
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,950
Arthur...

606
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,510
Stallions. Great big ones.
They looked real.

607
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,440
Arthur. Not stallions, not now.

608
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,350
I should have done more
with my life, John. Good things.

609
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,030
~ Arthur, for God's sake...
~ Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

610
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,590
~ Arthur, will you listen?
~ They are going to hang me, John.

611
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,030
They're not going to hang you.

612
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,120
Says who?

613
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,360
Tommy.

614
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,230
And how is Houdini going to get me
out of this?

615
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,480
~ Well...
~ Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

616
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,230
~ But you don't know what that
plan is, do you, John? ~ I do...

617
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,950
Because we just, we can't be
trusted.

618
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,590
All right. If he's
so fucking clever, why am I in here?

619
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,590
~ Well... ~ Why is all our men and half
our whisky being lifted?

620
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,030
Hmm?

621
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,230
The Jew and the cockney have run
rings round him.

622
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,590
~ Will you shut up? ~ Look at you. Look.

623
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,030
A big fucking man...

624
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,320
Fucking shut up!

625
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,680
He's already
told me what I've got to do.

626
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,790
What business have you got here?

627
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,110
I just pulled over.
I never smoke and drive, you know.

628
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,670
Where are you from?

629
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,390
I'm from Ireland.

630
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,870
The beautiful north, where the
rocks sing in the wind.

631
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,270
Where in the beautiful north?

632
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,230
You know, I just pulled
over for a fag.

633
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,230
I want to see some identification.

634
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,960

♪ Tomorrow might never come... ♪

642
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,830
May!

643
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,560
Tommy!

644
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,200
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

645
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,400
Yep. It really does.

646
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,040
Anyway, I thought it would
make you smile.

647
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,230
I'm sorry that
you had to drive through the night.

648
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,520
Must be exhausted. You can
go and sleep if you want.

649
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,600
May?

650
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,000
We have to stop.

651
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,120
This.

652
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,480
I came here to tell you
we have to stop.

653
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,440
Why?

654
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,000
Because I'm me and you're you?
That old thing?

655
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,640
There's someone.

656
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,640
For a long time.

657
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,590
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how it's going to be

658
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,680
after the race.

659
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,190
Not many of your people
know about me

660
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,590
so I haven't done the damage
that would come.

661
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,680
"My people"?

662
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,520
~ But the damage isn't done,
is what I mean. ~ Right.

663
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,350
And even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

664
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,070
To stay. Yes, of course.

665
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,270
Epsom is close.

666
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,440
I haven't got my outfit yet,
so it's all right.

667
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,790
You can still be with me
in the enclosure.

668
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,710
Very gracious of you, Sir(!)

669
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,150
You can wear something...

670
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,190
It's funny, isn't it,

671
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,510
because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

672
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,280
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

673
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,390
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

674
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,400
I will be covered in mud,
from the ring.

675
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,870
May, forget about men like me.

676
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,400
I was going to tell you how much
she's improved.

677
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,350
There are other men who...

678
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,630
I think she stands
a chance of placing. So...

679
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,430
So the silly
part of our business is done.

680
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,080
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham, or...?

681
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,990
What if I said, er, "All right, I'll
stay"?

682
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,560
After what I just said.

683
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,240
Then that would be all right.

684
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,390
You talk about "damage".
The damage not yet done.

685
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,670
You don't think half of London
already thinks

686
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,240
that I am fucking a racketeer?

687
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,880
Laughing about it. Laying bets on
when you'll steal the silver.

688
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,480
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

689
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:26,550
So that is why you carry on, eh?

690
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,240
Because you can't back down.

691
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,000
Amongst many other illogical
reasons.

692
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,230
So will you drive straight off, or?

693
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,440
I haven't got any
petrol in the garage.

694
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,790
I have some
cans of petrol in the car.

695
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,240
Good. So you can go.

696
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,680
They look happy in there, eh?

697
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,680
And why wouldn't they be?

698
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,320
Who is she?

699
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,320
Someone who's sailing away.

700
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,080
So let her sail.

701
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,750
You've told me about her. Like a
gentleman.

702
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
Now kindly behave
like a gangster again.

703
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,560
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

704
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,560
Because your horse will come
fifth or sixth.

705
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
But I will win you.

706
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,190
Mr Shelby is just parking his car.

707
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,080
He said for you to wait in here.

708
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,080
Isn't this is impressive?

709
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,840
And what is it you exactly do here?

710
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,030
I exactly am a secretary to
Mr Shelby.

711
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,590
A secretary! My, my, my!

712
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,120
All that paperwork.

713
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,390
Do you want tea?

714
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,480
No.

715
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,000
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell. Everything of value.

716
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,070
Take a seat.

717
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,440
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

718
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,030
Why do you ask?

719
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,920
Oh. Just give her my regards.

720
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,920
Ah!

721
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,920
You like to play with fire, don't
you, Mr Shelby?

722
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,670
Yesterday,

723
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,390
in Belgravia,

724
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,870
Field Marshall Russell's house was
burnt out.

725
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,910
An incendiary device was put
through his letter box.

726
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,000
Which means

727
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,830
that he will have to find somewhere
else to live

728
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,880
for at least the next three months.

729
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:56,190
Which also means that your plan for
me to break in and shoot him

730
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,230
in his bed is no longer
an operational possibility.

731
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,390
Indeed, but if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

732
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,550
think again...

733
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,030
I will keep my side of the bargain.

734
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,150
Oh, by God, you will.

735
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,590
I will shoot your Field Marshal.

736
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,390
But I will do it in a way that
serves my purpose.

737
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,510
The only purpose is MY purpose.

738
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,720
I will carry out the assassination
at a place of my choosing.

739
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,720
Listen to me.

740
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,870
All operational
detail must be mutually agreed.

741
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,310
I am a soldier of experience and
I will determine where and when...

742
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,230
Now, that man has 24-hour
armed police protection.

743
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,350
Your plan was full of holes,
Mr Campbell.

744
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,830
My plan was mutually agreed!

745
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,230
And now your plan is up in smoke!

746
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,830
And I have formulated the only
viable alternative.

747
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,000
For God's sake. What do you mean?

748
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,120
How would you get to him?

749
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,510
I won't.

750
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,920
He'll come to me.

751
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,790
Now listen to me, Mr Shelby.

752
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,910
When this meeting is concluded

753
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,950
I must report directly to
Mr Winston Churchill.

754
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,350
Your relationship with
Mr Churchill is not my concern.

755
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,030
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear details.

756
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,640
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

757
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,960
Look, Mr Campbell, I will
carry out my mission.

758
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,150
~ Good. Good. ~ But I will do it in a
place where it will be impossible

759
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,640
for you or your men to have me
shot afterwards.

760
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,350
Because that was your plan, eh?

761
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,550
Coppers front and back. No way out.

762
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,190
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

763
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,190
I will do the killing,

764
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,640
but in a place where that will
not be an option.

765
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,760
I have recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

766
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,720
It's, er...

767
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,030
Well, perhaps you can guess which
one is my horse.

768
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,120
Where and when?

769
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,280
Epsom.

770
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,840
Derby day.

771
