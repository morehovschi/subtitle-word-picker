00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,840
There was a Chinese.

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,280
The washer women say she's a witch.
It helps them believe.

53

We don't mess with Chinese.

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,640

We agreed, Arthur.

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,700
I'm taking charge
of drumming up new money.

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,260

Kimber to be fixing races, hm?

61
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,700
Then what's got into you?

62
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,960
You think we can take on
the Chinese and Billy Kimber.

63
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,080
Billy's got a bloody army!

64
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,060
I think...Arthur. That's what I do.

65
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,180
I think...

66
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,060
..so that you don't have to.

we're here today to take

79
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,020
But before we have a show
of hands for that...

80
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,480
..let's have a show of hands
from all those who fought in France,

81
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,880
all those who stood side-by-side
with your comrades

82
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,140
and watched your comrades fall.
Raise your hands.

Is it you? MEN: No.

87
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,560
Is it your wives? MEN: No!

88
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,720
Who, then? Do they stand among us?
MEN: No!

89
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,840
Or do they sit at home, comfortable,
with a full belly

90
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,760
while you scrape to find enough to
put shoes on your children's feet!

91
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,260
MEN: Yes!
And what is the reward they offer
you for your sacrifices made?

92
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,960
A fucking cut in your wages!

93
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,960
THAT is your reward!

94
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,520
Raise a hand, all those
who want to strike!

95
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,380

Soon to be King, I'd bet.
You don't bet.

104
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,540
No, but these past few days
I've been speculating.

105
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
About what?

106
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,160
One of my Union comrades
has a sister,

107
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,040
works in the telegraph office
at the BSA factory.

108
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,880
She says over the past week
they've had messages

109
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,900
coming up from London to the brass -
from Winston Churchill himself.

110
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,820
Something about a robbery.

111
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,420
"A robbery of national
significance", it said.

112
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,300
She found the list of names
left on the telegraph machine.

113
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,500
And on that list was your name
and my name together.

114
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,340
What kind of a list would have
the name of a Communist and the name
of a bookmaker side-by-side?

115
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,220
Perhaps it's a list of men
who give false hope to the poor.

116
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,640
The only difference
between you and me, Freddie,

117
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,680
is that sometimes...

118
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,420
my horses stand a chance of winning.

119
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,760
You know, there are days
when I hear about the cuttings

120
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,540
and beatings that I really wish I'd
let you take that bullet in France.

121
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,400
Believe me, there are nights
I wish you had.

00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,680

Danny!

128
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,680
Danny! Danny, you're home.
We're all home in England.

129
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,640
You're not in France.

130
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,480
You're not an artillery shell,
Danny, you're a man. Eh?

131
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,680
You're not a whizz bang.
You're a human being, Danny.

132
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,560
You're all right, you're all right,
you're all right.

133
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,540
Up! Up!

134
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,140
(It's all right, it's all right.)

135
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,260
Oh, hell. Did I do it again?

136
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,600
You did it again, Danny.

137
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,520
DANNY SOBS

138
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,300
Got to stop doing this, man.

139
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,320
It's all right.
Oh, God, Mr Shelby, I'm sorry...

140
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,720
It's all right. You go home
to your wife now, Danny.

141
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,680
Try and get all that smoke
and mud out of your head, eh.

142
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes, Mr Shelby. I'm sorry.

143
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,060
Go on.

144
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,080
Mr Shelby, you have to do
something about him.

145
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,640
Damn right, Harry.

146
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,420
You pay the Peaky Blinders
a lot of money for protection.

147
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,720
You're the law around here now,
Tommy, aren't you?

148
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,980
Maybe you should put a bullet
in Danny Whizz Bang's head
like they do with mad horses.

149
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,300
Maybe you'll have to put a bullet
in my head someday, too.

150
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,740
Bring the bill to the Peaky
Blinders. We'll take care of this.

151
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,660
Look at the gun.

152
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,660
Recognise it?

153
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,400
Oof!

154
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,000
Get up off your arse,
you mumping pig!

155
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,160
Aunt Pol! What the fuck
d'you do that for?!

156
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,960
Finn was playing with this this
afternoon by the cut. It was loaded.

157
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,040
He nearly blew Ada's tits off.

158
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,880
It must've fell out of my pocket.

159
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,000
He said he found it on the sideboard
of the betting shop...
with bullets in it.

160
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,780
Ma... I must've been drunk.

161
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,760
When are you not drunk?

162
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,360
Look, Aunt Pol, I'm sorry.

163
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,420
I'm...I'm sorry.

164
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,400
We'll keep this between ourselves

165
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,780
if you swear not to leave guns
lying around.

166
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,760
Look, I know having four kids
without a woman is hard.

167
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,100
But my boot's harder.
Now, come on, we're late.

168
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,160
'Right,

169
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,800
'I've called this family meeting
because I've got some
very important news.'

170
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,500
Scudboat and Lovelock got back
from Belfast last night.

171
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,640
They were buying a stallion
to cover their mares.

172
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,400
They were in a pub
on the Shankhill Road yesterday,

173
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,980
and in that pub,
there was a copper...

174
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,780
..handing out these.

175
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,580
"If you're over five feet
and can fight, come to Birmingham."

176
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,200
They're recruiting Protestant
Irishmen to come over here
as Specials.

177
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,440
To do what?
To clean up the city, Ada.

178
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,980
He's a Chief Inspector.

179
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,720
The last four years, he's been
clearing the IRA out of Belfast.

180
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,040
How do you know so bloody much?

181
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,480
Cos I asked the coppers
on our payroll.

182
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,020
And why didn't you tell me?

183
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm telling you.

184
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,640
So why are they sending him
to Birmingham?

185
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,360
Well, there's been all these
bloody strikes at the BSA...

186
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,320
and the Austin works lately.

187
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,920
Now the papers are talking
about sedition.

188
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,840
And revolution.

189
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,000
I reckon it's Communists he's after.

190
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,960
So this copper's going to
leave us alone, right?

191
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,640
There are Irishmen in Green Lanes
who left Belfast to get away
from him.

192
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,840
They say Catholic men who crossed
him used to disappear in the night.

193
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,380
Yeah, but we ain't IRA.
We bloody fought for the King.

194
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,120
Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders.
We're not scared of coppers.

195
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,560
He's right. If they come for us,
we'll cut them a smile each.

196
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,920
So, Arthur...

197
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,700
is that it?
What do you think, Aunt Pol?

198
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,500
This family does everything open.

199
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,160
You've nothing more to say
to this meeting, Thomas?

200
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,300
No.

201
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,280
Nothing that's women's business.

202
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,520
This whole bloody enterprise
was women's business
while you boys were away at war.

203
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,300
What's changed?

204
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,240
We came back.

205
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,840
And the Lord will smite the unholy
when the great judgment comes.

206
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,560
And judgment is coming, my friends.

207
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,720
Judgment is coming
to this wicked city.

208
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,320
And your wickedness and your
fornication will be revealed.

209
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,480
You cannot hide from the Creator.

210
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,800
You cannot hide from the Almighty
Himself. The Creator sees all.

211
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,560
You cannot hide
from the true and living God...

212
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,100
Get off with yer!

213
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,100
Fuck off!

214
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,660
That's it, I don't go any further.

215
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,340
COMMOTION AND SHOUTING

216
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,540
I have ten minutes.
What do you want?

217
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
An explanation.

218
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,820
I've always been able to tell when
you're hiding something.

219
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,820
People round here talk.

220
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,640
Some of them work at the BSA.

221
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,360
I've been talking to the wives
of factory hands.

222
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,540
Detectives have been asking questions
in the proofing shops.

223
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,200
Nothing happens in that factory
without you knowing about it.

224
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,320
Speak.

225
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,460
God and Aunt Polly are listening.

226
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,340
It was meant to be routine.

227
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,520
I had a buyer in London
for some...motorcycles.

228
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,700
I asked my men to steal me four
bikes with petrol engines.

229
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,120
I'm guessing my men were drunk.

230
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,860
There's a still inside the factory
makes tram-line gin.

231
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,980
They picked up the wrong
fucking crate.

232
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,040
The boys dropped it at Charlie
Strong's yard as agreed.

233
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,280
They must've taken it from
the proofing bay

234
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,820
instead of the export bay.

235
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,480
Holy sweet baby of Mary!

236
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,680
Inside we found 25 Lewis
machine guns,

237
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,640
10,000 rounds of ammunition,

238
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,880
50 semi-automatic rifles,
200 pistols with shells.

239
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,160
Jesus, Tommy!

240
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,180
All bound for Libya.

241
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,300
Sitting right there in Charlie
Strong's yard.

242
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,320
Tell me you threw them in the cut.

243
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,800
We put 'em in the stables,
out of the rain.

244
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,660
The guns hadn't been greased yet.

245
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,420
So that's why they sent a copper
from Belfast.

246
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,340
Maybe, maybe not.

247
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,080
Thomas, you're a bookmaker,
a robber, a fighting man,

248
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,720
you're not a fool.

249
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,340
You sell those guns to anyone who
has use to 'em, you will hang!

250
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,560
Dump them somewhere the police
can find them.

251
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,560
Maybe if they know they haven't
fallen into the wrong hands

252
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,200
this might blow over.

253
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,360
Tell Charlie to dump them tonight.

254
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,600
No. He won't move contraband
under a full moon.

255
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,000
Three days until it wanes.

256
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,220
Then you'll do the right thing?

257
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,440
You have your mother's common sense,
but your father's devilment.

258
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,520
I see them fighting.

259
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,420
Let your mother win.

260
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,440
I got tickets for the Penny Crush.
They're showing a Tom Mix picture.

261
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm not in the mood for the pictures
tonight, Ada.

262
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,360
Well, I'm not doing it here again.
I got covered in mud last time.

263
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,080
Let's just walk a bit.

264
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,520
If we go down as far as Greet,
we could go to a pub.

265
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,000
Your brothers have friends in Greet.

266
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,840
They have friends everywhere.
We'd have to walk to London.

267
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,520
I'm with you because you're the only
man round here not scared of them.

268
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,720
Oh, I'm scared of them all right.

269
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,260
But you love me more than
you fear them, right?

270
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,980
I don't want to be
always sneaking about.

271
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,420
Soon, we'll tell them. When?

272
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,020
How did the family meeting go?

273
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,720
Usual. There's a new copper coming.
I heard.

274
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,560
Hmm. And Tommy says he's after
the likes of you.

275
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,920
So maybe you should burn your books
and stop making speeches.

276
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,200
Oh, my Ada.

277
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,680
The only princess of the royal
family of the Kingdom of Small Heath.

278
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,460
I'm just a poor communist frog
with a big mouth.

279
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,380
Give me a kiss, Princess Ada.
SHE LAUGHS

280
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,020
I'm here about the job as a barmaid.

281
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,280
Are you mad? Am I what?

282
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,120
Do you know about this place?
I saw it in an advertisement.

283
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,920
Job's been filled.
It was in yesterday's paper.

284
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,680
Believe me, love,
I'm doing you a favour.

285
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,020
I'm not asking for favours,
I'm asking for employment.

286
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,520
You're too...nice.

287
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,040
How would you know? And too pretty.

288
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,280
They'd have you up against a wall.

289
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,740
I have experience and references.

290
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,560
What part of Ireland are you from?

291
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,880
Galway. Ah!

292
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,420
I worked in Dublin.

293
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Me mother was from Galway.

294
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,000
You're too pretty.

295
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,640
Watch.

296
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,540
And listen.

297
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:36,720
♪ I wish I was in Carrickfergus

303

HE LAUGHS

304
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,580
In Ireland my singing made them cry
and stopped them fighting.

305
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,420
Well, I hope you know
a lot of songs.

306
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,460
CHATTER

307
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,320
Babies...

308
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,820
discarded...with the fish bones
and eggshells.

309
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,020
Girls, 11 years old...

310
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,640
..pierced and punctured by old men
for thruppence a time!

311
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,200
Rutted upon like animals!

312
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,800
Degradation.

313
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:40,440
Fathers with their daughters,
brothers and sisters sharing beds.

314
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,720
Beggars and thieves left to run
in the streets.

315
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,580
And astride the whole stinking
pile of wounds and rotten flesh...

316
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,880
..your masters!

317
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,940
The men who you touch your cap to.

318
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,100
The Peaky Blinders!

319
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,960
The vicious...merciless gangs

320
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,900
who blind those that see and cut out
the tongues of those who talk.

321
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,580
You are worse than them!

322
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,160
Those of you who have taken their
bribes these years since the war,

323
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:31,220
those of you who look the other way,
you...are worse than them!

324
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,380
God damn you for soiling
your uniforms!

325
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:47,080
And then...there are the IRA Fenians
and the Communists.

326
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,720
Blacker hearts still.

327
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,860
They feed on the puss of all this
corruption like maggots in a corpse.

328
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,040
And like maggots, if left to swell
they will eventually swarm like flies

329
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,000
and spread their rotten philosophy
across the country
and across the world!

330
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,820
Those then...are our enemies!

331
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,800
A three-headed beast.

332
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,980
It is my job to decapitate each one
and by God I will do it!

333
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:32,660
I don't trust any of yous
until you earn my trust!

334
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,840
And that takes some earning.

335
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,060
DOOR OPENS

336
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,780
These are the new men
who will bolster your ranks.

337
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,360
Good men...

338
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,820
from God-fearing families.

339
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,240
By the time the sun sets, they will
be sworn in and in uniform.

340
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,940
And by sunrise tomorrow,
they will be on the streets.

341
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,620
God help those who stand in our way!

342
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,200
CHATTER

343
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,080
Sorry, Mr Shelby.

344
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,740
Right. Move out of the way for Mr
Shelby. Mr Shelby. This way.

345
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,920
You see, ladies,

346
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,500
when you're out with a Blinder,
you don't have to queue.

347
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,280
Right...I want a blow job
off both of you

348
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,720
before they let
the ordinary people in.

349
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,800
Away you go. Take your hat off.

350
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,520
What the fuck?!

351
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,120
Who the fuck are you?!

352
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm Arthur-fucking-Shelby!

353
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,020
HE GROANS

354
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,300
HE GROANS

355
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,080
Arthur Shelby.

356
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,020
Lead pack dog of the Peaky Blinders.

357
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,940
SHELBY GROANS

358
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,300
Look at me.

359
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,500
Bastard!

360
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,400
Your uniform?

361
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,560
Terrifying, I'm sure.

362
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:07,140
Did he have a gun? No gun. A knife
in his sock, cosh in his belt.

363
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,520
Now, Mr Shelby...

364
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,720
I want you to see this as me
introducing myself to you.

365
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,760
Understand?

366
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,160
In all the world the only thing
that interests me is the truth.

367
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,140
So...

368
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,120
..what do you know about the robbery?

369
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,900
What robbery?

370
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,780
HE WHIMPERS

371
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,740
I will ask you again.

372
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,520
What do you know...about
the robbery?

373
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,520
I swear to God, I don't know
what you're talking about.

374
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,780
What fucking robbery?

375
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,240
Argh!

376
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,660
HE GROANS

377
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:14,000
Aye, after 35 years of dealing
with animals like you,

378
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,340
I can tell just by sniffing the
air...whether or not you're lying.

379
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,960
I'm not fucking lying!

380
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,580
All right? I'm not fucking lying!

381
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
I know.

382
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,380
I see nothing of interest behind
the blood in your eyes.

383
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,360
And no blood in your veins

384
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,620
that could carry...even a trace
of cunning or guile.

385
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
But understand this.

386
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:04,000
It is well within my power to have
you and the rest of your scum family

387
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,260
face down in the canal
before the year is out.

388
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
On the other hand...

389
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,180
..we can help each other.

390
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,820
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

391
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,320
Is it always this busy on a daytime?
No. These boys are on their way
to St Andrews.

392
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,160
To pray? That'll be the day.
St Andrews is a football ground.

393
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,200
The Blues are playing.
That's the forward line there.

394
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,500
And that's the goalie,
believe it or not. Hello!

395
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,000
I need a bottle of rum.

396
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,760
Grace, whatever it is,
it's on the house.

397
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,040
A whole bottle? Yeah.
White or dark rum? Don't care.

398
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,460
Right, lads, what'll it be? Two?

399
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,500
Thank you.

400
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,940
Harry said it's on the house.

401
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,540
Are you a whore?

402
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,740
Cos if you're not,
you're in the wrong place.

403
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,480
He's one of them
you warned me about?

404
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,800
Look, Grace, you're a friendly girl
but be careful.

405
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,640
If I say something's on the house,
then say nothing
to whoever you're serving.

406
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,320
If they decide that they want you,
then there's nothing
anybody could do about it.

407
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,760
Lucky for you, since he got back
from France, Tommy doesn't want
anybody at all.

408
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,400
Yes, lads?

409
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,640
HE GROANS

410
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,720
John, wipe the blood out of his eye.
Since when did you give orders?

411
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm a trained nurse. Don't make me
laugh, it hurts me face.

412
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,240
I bloody am! You went to one
first-aid class in the church hall

413
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,960
and got thrown out for giggling.

414
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,040
Not before I learnt how to stop
somebody from choking.
I'm not bloody choking, am I?

415
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:08,120
You will be when I wrap this cloth
round your neck.

416
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,400
Let me see him.

417
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,380
All right, have this.

418
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,780
HE GROANS
Give me that.

419
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,380
You're all right.

420
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,740
He said Mr Churchill
sent him to Birmingham.

421
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,560
National interest, he said.

422
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,740
Something about a robbery.

423
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,040
He said he wants us to help him.
We don't help coppers.

424
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,040
He knew all about our war records.

425
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,500
He said we're patriots...like him.

426
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,940
He wants us to be his eyes and ears.

427
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,960
I said...
HE GROANS

428
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,540
I said we'd have a family meeting
and take a vote.

429
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,940
Well, why not? Hmm? We've no truck
with Fenians or communists.

430
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,640
What's wrong with you?

431
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,440
What the fuck is wrong
with him lately?!

432
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,240
If I knew, I'd buy the cure
from Compton's Chemists.

433
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,280

00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,500
Why do you think that is, Harry?

447
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,380
HEAVY BREATHING

448
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,820
So did Arthur say what kind of deal
this new copper offered him?

449
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,300
God! The second your balls are empty
it's back onto politics.

450
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,520
What did Tommy say?

451
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,400
He didn't say anything.
You know what he's like.

452
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,080
Yeah, I know what he's like.

453
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,480
He likes to take his fights
onto the mud.

454
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,360
Doesn't like to stand and wait.

455
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:38,080
You know what he'd do
if he found out about us.

456
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,600
He could try.

457
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,660
Sometimes, it's like you're with me
just to show you can.

458
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,100
One day me and Tommy will be
on the same side again.

459
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,060
Tommy...! Aargh.

460
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,380
MEN SHOUT

461
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,300
HE RANTS INCOHERENTLY

462
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,580
Hey, what you do?
We're closed. Go home.

463
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,960
Go home, crazy man.
HE RANTS INCOHERENTLY

464
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,040
I said go home, crazy man!

465
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,240
SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

466
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,600
I said go home.

467
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,580
Fix bayonets!!!

468
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,260
WOMEN SCREAM

469
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,460
Secretary of State,
this is Chief Inspector Campbell.

470
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,960
Mr Churchill, sir, may I say what
a great honour it is to meet you.

471
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,960
Bit of a whistle stop tour.

472
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,940
Love the hat, by the way.
Thank you. It's beaver.

473
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,260
So, how are you settling in?

474
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,600
I have set up a command network.

475
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,160
I have agents in place
across the city

476
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,880
who will act as my eyes and ears.

477
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,320
And I have begun to interrogate
suspects vigorously.

478
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:49,560
You were in Belfast. I understand
you broke a few Fenian hearts.

479
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,160
A rat's nest, sir.

480
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,680
So who do you think stole the guns?
Fenians or Communists?

481
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,800
If it is IRA Fenians, I will
find them and find the guns.

482
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,120
If it is Communists, I will find them
and find the guns.

483
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,440
If it is common criminals,
I will find them and find the guns.

484
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,540
To me there are no distinction
between any of the above.

485
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,560
We chose you
because you are effective.

486
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,280
But remember this, Mr Campbell.
This is England, not Belfast.

487
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,480
Bodies thrown in the rivers,
wash up in the papers here.

488
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,800
We must keep the existence of these
stolen guns out of the news

489
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
otherwise we will simply be
advertising them for sale.

490
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,700
If there are bodies to be buried,
dig holes and dig them deep.

491
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,420
I want everything accounted for
down to the last bullet.

492
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,560
Uncle Charlie, a word.

493
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,860
They are aboard. There's no moon.

494
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,520
We can take them out to the turning
point beyond Gas Street

495
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,520
and leave them on the bank.

496
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,980
They'll be found by railway men
first thing.

497
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,060
Is that agreement?

498
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,780
I changed my mind.

499
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,700
You what?

500
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,380
I have an alternative strategy.

501
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,960
Tell Curly to take her out
to the old tobacco wharf.

502
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,760
There's a lock up mooring
we used to keep cigarettes.

503
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,840
He knows it.

504
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,300
When the boat leaves your yard,
it's no longer your concern.

505
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,380
Have you lost your fucking mind?

506
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,480
Have you not seen the streets?

507
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,960
They've sent a fucking army
to find these things...

508
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,960
That's right.
They've shown their hand...

509
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,320
Their hand?

510
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,560
If they want them back this bad,
they'll have to pay.

511
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,440
That's the way of the world.

512
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,320
Fortune drops something
valuable in your lap,

513
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,100
you don't just dump it
on the bank of the cut.

514
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,560
You're blood, Tommy.

515
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,980
I've always looked out for you
like a dad.

516
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,300
You're going to bring holy hell
down on your head.

517
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,140
This copper takes no prisoners.

518
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,980
I'm told he didn't serve.

519
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,300
Reserved occupation.

520
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,740
Is it another war
you're looking for, Tommy?

521
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,280
The tobacco wharf.

522
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,940
By order of the Peaky Blinders.

523
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,980
Are you in position?

524
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,700
I am, sir.

525
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,100
Your first impressions?

526
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,260
I am quite shocked at how
these people live.

527
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,400
Have you found anything
out that might help me?

528
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,000
I interrogated the head of the Peaky
Blinders. He didn't know anything.

529
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,640
A brute.

530
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,360
It strikes me that it isn't Arthur
who heads the Shelby family.

531
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:46,740
It is the younger one, Thomas.

532
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,240
They say he won two medals
for gallantry in the war.

533
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,780
You sound fascinated.

534
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,000
However, my opinion has not changed.

535
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,640
The bookmaker gangs
have other business

536
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,420
and the Communists are too weak
to have planned this.

537
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,700
I believe the guns
were taken by the IRA.

538
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,700
You must not let your personal
history cloud your judgment.

539
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,540
What history?

540
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,660
That the IRA murdered my father
will not affect my judgment.

541
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,860
If you see any guns, check the
serial numbers against that list.

542
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:48,640
Your father was the finest officer
I ever worked with.

543
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,500
I know he would be very,
very proud of you.

544
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,560
Danny, as you know, the man
you killed was Italian.

545
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,380
And those two men
over there are his brothers.

546
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,520
If I let the Italians do this,
Danny,

547
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,040
they'll cut off your manhood
and let you drain.

548
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,100
That's how those bastards do things.

549
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,900
So, to stop a war breaking
out between us and the Italians...

550
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:50,100
..and to save you from
their barbarity...

551
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,620
..I said I would
dispatch you myself.

552
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,180
They are here to witness.

553
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,040
I died over there anyway, Tommy.

554
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,780
I left my fucking brains in the mud.

555
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,220
You have any last requests, comrade?

556
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,980
You'll look out for my Rosie
and my boys?

557
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,820
See they get apprenticeships.
At the BSA factory or the Austin.

558
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,720
They'll make foremen.
I know they will.

559
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,460
Just ordinary...

560
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,540
Just ordinary men.

561
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,640
And they won't get told
to do this shit...

562
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,580
This shit... This shit
that we got told to do.

563
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,220
I suppose I ought to pray now.

564
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,780
Those fucking guns blew God
right out of my head.

565
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,820
Is that boat for me?

566
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,040
We have to get your body out
of the city, Danny.

567
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,680
This new copper, you know...

568
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:37,560
Don't bury me anywhere
where there's mud. OK?

569
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,220
Promise me.

570
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,460
Bury me on a hill
and tell Rosie where.

571
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,780
You were a good man
and a good soldier.

572
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,620
Yes, Sergeant Major.

573
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,020
In the bleak midwinter.

574
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,900
GUNSHOT

575
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,780
Where are you?

576
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,320
It bloody won!

577
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,780
Monaghan Boy bloody won!

578
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,220
Yeah. It won.

579
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,360
And word will spread.

580
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,800
So next time we do the powder trick
it won't just be The Garrison

581
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:36,160
that'll bet on the horse,
it'll be the whole of Small Heath.

582
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,800
And you know what?
The horse will win again.

583
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,000
And the third time we do it

584
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,320
we'll have the whole of Birmingham
betting on it.

585
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,640
A thousand quid bet
on the magic horse.

586
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,900
And that time, when we are ready,
the horse will lose.

587
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,780
Think about it.

588
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,600
You OK, Danny?

589
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,540
I'm still in shock.

590
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,680
You sure this isn't heaven?

591
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
If it was heaven,
what would I be doing here?

592
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,640
Tommy wanted you to think
it was real

593
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,480
to try and knock some
sense into you.

594
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:58,280
A shell full of sheep brains
hurts pretty bad.

595
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,780
It was meant to.

596
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,840
So where are you taking me?
London.

597
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:08,100
Tommy has a little job for you.
Give you chance to say thanks.

598
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,820
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny.

599
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,420
A bad week.

600
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,720
There was no moon last night.
I checked.

601
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,520
Did you do the right thing?

602
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,780
Yes, I did the right thing.
