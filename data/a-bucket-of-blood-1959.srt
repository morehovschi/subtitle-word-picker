1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,972
I will talk to you of art,

2
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,308
for there is nothing else to talk about,

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,978
for there is nothing else.

4
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,230
Life is an obscure hobo,

5
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:23,858
bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.

6
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,569
Burn gas buggies.

7
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:30,239
And whip your sour cream
of circumstance and hope,

8
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,076
and go ahead and sleep
your bloody heads off.

9
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,746
Creation is.

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:38,998
All else is not.

11
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,461
What is not creation is graham crackers.

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,548
Let it all crumble to feed the creator.

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,260
The artist is.

14
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:52,970
All others are not.

15
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,640
A canvas is a canvas or a painting.

16
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,772
A rock is a rock or a statue.

17
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,816
A sound is a sound.

18
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:08,778
Or is music.

19
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:15,326
A creature is a creature or an artist.

20
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:19,246
(light jazz music)

21
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,711
Where are John, Joe, Jake, Jim, Jerk?

22
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,713
Dead.

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,881
Dead.

24
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,049
Dead.

25
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,717
They were not born.

26
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,887
Before they were born, they were not born.

27
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,100
Where are Leonardo, Rembrandt, Ludwig?

28
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:41,059
Alive.

29
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,395
Alive.

30
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,562
Alive.

31
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,566
They were born.

32
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,694
Bring on the multitude
with a multitude of fishes.

33
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,907
Feed them to the fishes for liver oil.

34
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,159
To nourish the artist.

35
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,703
Stretch their skins upon an easel.

36
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,206
To give him canvas.

37
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,085
Crush their bones into a paste.

38
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,336
That he might mold them.

39
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,881
Let them die.

40
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,301
And by their miserable deaths

41
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,595
become the clay within his hands

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,642
that he might form an ashtray or an ark.

43
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,814
For all that is comes through
the eye of the artist.

44
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,735
The rest are blind fish swimming
in the cave of aloneness.

45
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:37,366
Swim on, you maudlin,
muddling, maddened fools.

46
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,829
And dream that one bright and sunny night,

47
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,459
some artist will bait a hook
and let you bite upon it.

48
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,880
Bite hard and die.

49
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,802
In his stomach, you are
very close to immortality.

50
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,933
(audience applauding)

51
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Walter?

52
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,938
Walter, what are you doing here?

53
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,291
I was looking at Carla's picture.

54
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,635
Do I pay you to look at pictures?

55
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,692
Now get to work.

56
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,235
I was just lookin'.

57
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,838
There are empty cups all over the place.

58
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,862
Clear them out.

59
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,409
You shouldn't be so
rough on him, Leonard.

60
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,582
What do you say, Walter?

61
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:27,875
Hi.

62
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,961
(upbeat jazz music)

63
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:39,636
I think I'll cut.

64
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,107
There's the man.

65
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:52,942
How you makin' it?

66
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,027
- Fine, man, how about you?
- Good enough.

67
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,664
(phone ringing)

68
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,291
- Valdez Vice.
- Yeah, Lacroix checkin' in.

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,085
Lou took over a couple of minutes ago.

70
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:12,503
Anything new at the door?

71
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,910
Nothing you can pound nails in.

72
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,130
A couple of hustlers.

73
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,466
One of them is short, fat, brunette.

74
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,634
Name's Skinny.

75
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:19,961
The other one was short also.

76
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,428
She was bleached and skinny.

77
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,806
- Name of fat.
- Probably.

78
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:24,807
I didn't get it.

79
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,475
They didn't give any pitches, though.

80
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,185
Guess you can keep an eye on 'em.

81
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,104
[Paul] Okay, any heads?

82
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,147
Well, Jerry Sachs looked
like he was straight.

83
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,525
I'm sure he's on it, anyway.

84
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,835
I didn't see any pushers around the place.

85
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,112
Lou said he'd check out
Jerry and sound him out later

86
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,780
if he gets any higher.

87
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,699
I guess that's about it.

88
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,033
Okay, Art.

89
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,161
Go on home and get a good
night's sleep, you fink.

90
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:46,996
Okay.

91
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,162
So long, Paul.

92
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,667
Everyone listened to my new poem,

93
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:52,978
but do you think they really heard it?

94
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,713
- I heard it, Mr. Brock.
- Thank you, Walter.

95
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,423
I'm sure you did.

96
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,134
"Bring on the multitude
with a multitude of fishes.

97
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,778
"Feed them to the fishes for liver oil

98
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,095
"to nourish the artist."

99
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,848
That was word for word.

100
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:06,682
Is it?

101
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,975
I'd forgotten.

102
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,462
You don't remember your own poem?

103
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,103
I refuse to say anything twice.

104
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
Repetition is death.

105
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,273
I don't get it.

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,480
When you repeat something,

107
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,735
you are reliving a moment, wasting it,

108
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,903
severing it from the
other end of your life.

109
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,115
I believe only in new impressions,
new stimuli, new life.

110
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,492
I thought you believed
that life is an obscure hobo,

111
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,452
bumming a ride on the...

112
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,637
I do believe that, Walter,

113
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,830
but I also believe creative living.

114
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,916
To be uncreative, you might
as well be in your grave,

115
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,083
or in the army.

116
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,338
They tried to draft me once.

117
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,797
I couldn't pass the test.

118
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,510
Walter, Leonard's looking at you.

119
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,099
He's just about gone.

120
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,851
Walter has a clear mind.

121
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,120
One day, something will enter it,

122
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,021
feel lonely, and leave again.

123
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,481
Too much.

124
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,358
Yes, Cats, yes.

125
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,234
If you want to know how beatniks live,

126
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,153
William and me will show you.

127
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,572
We'll introduce you to some wild ones.

128
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,325
You may even discover
an artist of your own.

129
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,702
And how much is that going to cost us?

130
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,536
What cost?

131
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,371
A couple of bucks.

132
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,015
You wanna meet some beatniks, don't you?

133
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,039
Oh, no, it's the artists.

134
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,666
I'm just crazy about artists.

135
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,835
All that is comes through
the eye of the artist.

136
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,128
The rest are just blind fish

137
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,655
swimming in the cave of aloneness.

138
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,465
Oh, you must be an artist.

139
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,300
And working as a busboy too.

140
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,469
Feed him that, he will be satisfied.

141
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,387
The artist is.

142
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,805
All others are not.

143
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,681
That's most intriguing.

144
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,641
Are you a painter?

145
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, no.

146
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,727
I'm working on something.

147
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,978
It's not ready yet.

148
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:35,938
What is it, man?

149
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,106
Finger painting?

150
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,108
Draw me a picture of a house, Walter.

151
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,919
Make some smoke coming out of the chimney.

152
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:41,983
I am working on something.

153
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,903
I'll show you soon.

154
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,070
Walter.

155
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,743
Is he, uh...

156
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,725
Did you get a good look, kid?

157
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,894
Go on home.

158
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,467
Hello, Mrs. Swickard.

159
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:47,301
Oh, Walter.

160
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,760
You look awful pale.

161
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,071
What did you have to eat tonight?

162
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,639
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swickard.

163
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,974
If you were my son.

164
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,035
Why don't you let me fix
you a nice bowl of soup.

165
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,186
Won't take but a minute.

166
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,020
It's okay.

167
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,267
I can fix myself something.

168
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,036
Besides, I got something important to do.

169
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,106
Oh, say, Walter.

170
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,902
Did you see anything of Frankie
tonight when you went out?

171
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,068
I didn't see him at all.

172
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,572
If you do, tell him I've
got a nice, fresh piece

173
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,823
of halibut for him.

174
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,033
Tell him that?

175
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,720
I mean, do you think he'll understand?

176
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,369
He's only a cat.

177
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,205
Good night, Walter.

178
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,125
(light jazzy music)

179
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,928
(cat meowing)

180
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,187
Frankie?

181
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,658
A canvas is a canvas or a painting.

182
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,036
A rock is a rock or a statue.

183
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,540
A sound is a sound, or it's music.

184
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:39,472
Come on.

185
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,349
Be a nose.

186
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,979
Be a nose.

187
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,359
(cat meowing)

188
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,882
Frankie, shut up!

189
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,385
(cat meowing)

190
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,654
Oh, what's the matter, Frankie?

191
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,346
How'd you get yourself stuck in a wall?

192
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,306
(cat meowing)

193
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,016
Wait a minute, I'll get you out.

194
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,736
(cat squealing)

195
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,030
Frankie?

196
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,283
Frankie?

197
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,955
You all right, Frankie?

198
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,341
Oh, Frankie.

199
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,178
Oh, Frankie.

200
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,103
Oh, Frankie.

201
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,604
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,699
Poor Mrs. Swickard.

203
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,999
She had a nice fresh
piece of halibut for you.

204
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,213
I'll give you to her in the morning.

205
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,723
Repetition is death, Frankie.

206
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,726
(sobbing)

207
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,073
[Maxwell voiceover] Let them die.

208
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,033
And by their miserable deaths

209
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,036
become the clay within his hands

210
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:52,374
that he might form an ashtray or an ark.

211
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:58,213
Pray that you might be his
diadem, gold, glory, paint, clay,

212
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,717
that he might take you in
his magic hands and wring

213
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,970
from your marrow wonders.

214
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,976
Where are John, Joe, Jim, Jerk?

215
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,028
Dead.

216
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:23,864
Dead.

217
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,030
Dead.

218
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,003
Hi, Carla.

219
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,674
Well, Walter, what are
you doing here so early?

220
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,508
I've brought something.

221
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,467
I think you'll like it.

222
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,344
Take that stuff to
the laundromat, Walter.

223
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,388
- Huh?
- Don't mind him.

224
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,555
What have you got?

225
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:50,765
It's a thing I made.

226
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,317
Walter.

227
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,235
- You like it?
- What's he got?

228
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,404
Come look at this, Leonard.

229
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,947
Where'd you get that, an auction?

230
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,782
[Walter] I made it.

231
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:08,949
You made that?

232
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:09,784
I said I did, didn't I?

233
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,078
Walter, it's very good.

234
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,245
- Honest?
- Honest.

235
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,247
What's it called?

236
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,750
Dead Cat.

237
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,959
Dead Cat?

238
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,127
That's its name?

239
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:20,629
Sure.

240
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,048
Well, it sure looks dead enough.

241
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,716
You wanna buy it?

242
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:25,550
Buy it?

243
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,384
That thing?

244
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,720
It'd scare people out of the place.

245
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,388
Don't be silly.

246
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,556
It's tremendous.

247
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,183
Look at the detail.

248
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,601
The anatomy's perfect.

249
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,895
Look at the expression on its face.

250
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,523
How come you put a knife into it?

251
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,690
I didn't mean to.

252
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,027
Just got carried away, huh?

253
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,947
Well, all right.

254
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,324
I'll tell you what I'll do.

255
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,885
I'll put it in the corner of the alcove.

256
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,078
If it sells, we'll split 50-50, okay?

257
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,454
Sure.

258
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,331
Does this mean I'm an artist?

259
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,084
Maybe so, if you can
do other things as well.

260
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,795
All that is comes through
the eye of the artist.

261
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,463
Yeah, you're a real artist now.

262
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,133
Now go in back and scrub
down those garbage cans.

263
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
March now.

264
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,138
You really like it?

265
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,557
We like it.

266
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:15,724
Now go on.

267
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,693
(funky jazz music)

268
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,613
Did you see my cat?

269
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,407
What's the matter, you lose him?

270
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,125
How do you like my cat?

271
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,376
You made this thing, man?

272
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,877
Uh-huh.

273
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,045
It's crazy.

274
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,297
Crazy.

275
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:47,464
You wanna buy it?

276
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,718
Who me, man?

277
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:50,884
I'm tapped.

278
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:58,810
He likes my cat.

279
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,977
Get to work.

280
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:11,781
Hey, hey, Walter.

281
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,948
Come here a minute.

282
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,955
Hey, congratulations, man.

283
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,165
Walter, you're famous.

284
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,331
I saw your cat.

285
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,334
Did you like it, Mr. Brock?

286
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,961
You may call me Maxwell.

287
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,796
How'd you do it, Walter?

288
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,591
Oh, I just took some
clay and fixed it up.

289
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,010
(laughing)

290
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,303
Attention.

291
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,263
Attention, everyone.

292
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,110
As you passed through
these yellow portals,

293
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm sure you noticed on your
right a small clay figure

294
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,562
and assumed this transfixed effigy

295
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,190
to be the work of a master sculptor.

296
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,900
And indeed, so it is.

297
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,653
That master sculptor is in our midst.

298
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,239
He is none other than Walter Paisley,

299
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,701
our very own busboy whose hands of genius

300
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,038
have been carrying away the
empty cups of your frustrations.

301
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,333
Mark well this lad.

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,044
His is the silent voice of creation.

303
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,964
Within the dark, rich soil of humility,

304
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:13,927
he blossoms as the hope of
our nearly sterile century.

305
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,222
- (applauding)
- Beautiful, Maxwell.

306
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,349
Bring me an espresso, Walter.

307
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,642
Maxwell, really beautiful.

308
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:21,976
Thank you.

309
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,520
Man, you are in.

310
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,772
Oh, Walter, you're wonderful.

311
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,023
Wonderful!

312
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,151
(crowd chattering)

313
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,028
[Man] Listen, man, you got a pen?

314
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,201
Hey, Pops, what's happenin'?

315
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,828
Makin' a big scene for Walter.

316
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,621
Who'd he shoot?

317
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,788
He made a cat.

318
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,124
Out of clay.

319
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,628
- See you around.
- Yeah, later.

320
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,558
[Man] Will somebody
clear this table, please?

321
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,269
Will somebody clear this table?

322
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,900
Did you hear them, Mr. De Santis?

323
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,152
They all like my cat.

324
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,318
Yeah, very good.

325
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,863
Now, look, Walter.

326
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,447
You must be tired.

327
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,374
Why don't you take the
rest of the night off?

328
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,075
- I don't want to.
- No, no.

329
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,410
You got it coming.

330
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,887
Besides, you're creating an incident.

331
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,289
When people are applauding,
they don't order coffee.

332
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,375
So, go on home and work on something.

333
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,293
Make another cat.

334
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,087
Well, I haven't got another cat.

335
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:33,047
Look, just go to the movies.

336
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,007
Please, Walter.

337
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:34,841
Go.

338
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,217
All right, Mr. De Santis.

339
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,051
Good night.

340
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,218
Good night, Walter.

341
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,721
Walter.

342
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:41,472
Walter, wait a minute.

343
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,308
Oh, hello, Naolia.

344
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,727
Walter, I dug it.

345
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,312
My cat?

346
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,148
It was the most wonderful, wildest,

347
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,108
like, wiggiest thing I've ever seen.

348
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,737
Walter, you've done something to me.

349
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,199
Something deep down inside of my prana.

350
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,700
I have?

351
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,620
Oh, Walter, I wanna be with you.

352
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,996
You're creative.

353
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,417
You've got a hot light
bulb glowing inside of you,

354
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:12,003
and I wanna be warmed by it.

355
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,923
Gee, that's nice of you, Naolia.

356
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,342
Walter, take me away from here.

357
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:22,013
Take me away to some cool
blue place and gas me.

358
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,847
I can't.

359
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,224
I gotta go home.

360
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,618
Oh, then I'll go home with you.

361
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,309
Oh, no.

362
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,310
Mrs. Swickard wouldn't like that.

363
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,020
She's my landlady.

364
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,564
[Naolia] Isn't there
anything I can do for you?

365
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,567
I don't think so, Naolia.

366
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,735
Oh, Walter.

367
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,363
I can't let you just split like this.

368
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,114
I've gotta do something.

369
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,449
I've gotta contribute.

370
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,369
You don't have to do anything.

371
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,245
Wait.

372
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,624
Wait, there is one thing I can do.

373
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,959
One little thing.

374
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,794
Don't leave, Walter.

375
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,631
I wanna give you something.

376
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,758
Something that will make you remember me.

377
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,181
Put it in your pocket.

378
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,891
Now go, Walter.

379
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,144
Don't look back.

380
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,311
Just go!

381
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,956
Can I have your autograph, Mr. Paisley?

382
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:13,875
Why, certainly, my good woman.

383
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,587
Everybody likes my cat.

384
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,966
You wanna buy my statue, mister?

385
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,885
$10,000?

386
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,052
Okay.

387
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:29,724
Gee, I'll be famous.

388
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,853
And then I can ask Carla,
and she'll say yes.

389
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,563
I know she will.

390
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,367
(knocking on door)

391
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:54,874
Hello, Walter.

392
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:55,666
Oh, hi.

393
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,667
You're Lou, ain't you?

394
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,314
I seen you at the Yellow Door plenty.

395
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,461
Come on in.

396
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,922
I was just making some pancakes.

397
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,298
You can have some if you like.

398
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,674
Did you see my cat?

399
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,884
Yeah, I saw your cat.

400
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,677
I also saw that chick lay these on you.

401
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:07,887
Oh, that was Naolia.

402
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,389
She's a nice girl.

403
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:10,973
She's kind of strange, though.

404
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:14,185
I guess she figures I get
headaches or something.

405
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,788
Okay, Walter, who's your connection?

406
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,812
Connection?

407
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,980
Yeah, connection.

408
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,147
Who do you score from?

409
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,358
Where do you buy your horse?

410
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,567
Horse?

411
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,402
Horse.

412
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,236
Junk.

413
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,070
White stuff.

414
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:24,904
Heroin.

415
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,197
Is that what that is?

416
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:27,549
I never seen any of that before.

417
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,075
I always thought that was expensive.

418
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,494
Yeah, Walter, that
can be real expensive.

419
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,454
Gee, wasn't that nice of Naolia

420
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,039
to give me that expensive horse?

421
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,206
- Walter.
- Huh?

422
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,001
Police officer.

423
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,046
Oh, you're like an undercover man.

424
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,714
You're under arrest, Walter.

425
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:44,881
Under arrest for what?

426
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,175
Possession of narcotics.

427
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,009
Who, me?

428
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:48,469
What are you talking about?

429
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,221
Walter, I got you cold.

430
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,668
Now you just come along quietly.

431
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,099
I didn't do nothin'.

432
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,392
Naolia gimme those.

433
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,393
I didn't ask her for it.

434
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,703
I didn't even know...
Alright.

435
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,996
You can tell them that downtown.

436
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,729
Now let's go.

437
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,124
I ain't goin' no place with you.

438
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,417
Walter, do I have to point this at you?

439
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,942
You're gonna shoot me!

440
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,109
No, don't shoot me!

441
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,403
Walter, just relax.

442
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,404
No, you're gonna shoot me.

443
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,881
- Now just relax.
- Don't shoot me!

444
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,633
- Just shut up, would you?
- No, you're gonna shoot me!

445
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:10,908
Don't shoot!

446
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:15,997
(body thudding)
(sharp dramatic music)

447
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,668
- (knocking on door)
- Walter?

448
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,462
Walter!

449
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,799
Walter!

450
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,553
Are you all right?

451
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,722
I thought I heard you
shouting a minute ago.

452
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,058
(pots clanging)

453
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,560
Walter!

454
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,313
(pots clanging)

455
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,070
What's all the noise in here?

456
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:48,946
Noise, Mrs. Swickard?

457
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:49,822
What noise?

458
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,408
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket.

459
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,243
Are you sure you're all alone?

460
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,037
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swickard.

461
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,959
Walter, have you been
talkin' to yourself again?

462
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,667
Well, I guess maybe
I have, Mrs. Swickard.

463
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,002
Somebody's got to.

464
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,546
Walter, you know,
what you need is a girl.

465
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,465
She doesn't have to be pretty,

466
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,717
just so long as she
takes good care of you.

467
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,136
I can take real good care
of myself, Mrs. Swickard.

468
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,012
Yeah, I can see that.

469
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,597
Look at this pad.

470
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,431
It's terrible.

471
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:16,349
Why don't you ever clean it up?

472
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,352
And when did you change these sheets last?

473
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,562
They look like they're alive.

474
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:23,356
Mrs. Swickard, I gotta meet some friends

475
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,190
in a little while,

476
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,024
and I gotta take a shower.

477
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,877
- Why don't you clean up this dump
- If you don't mind.

478
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,737
Well, what's the matter with you?

479
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,803
I didn't mean to hurt you, Lou.

480
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,932
But if you'd have shot me, you'd
be moppin' up my blood now.

481
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,853
I can't help it if I
got scared and hit you.

482
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,355
I didn't mean it.

483
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,736
It's crazy.

484
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,155
It's crazy.

485
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,412
I didn't know you had it in you, Walter.

486
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,831
How'd you do it?

487
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,421
Well, I just took some
clay and fixed it up.

488
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,467
Go home and make something, Walter.

489
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:35,678
Make another cat.

490
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,649
But I haven't got another cat.

491
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,944
Well, I reported in
here around midnight.

492
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,488
Lou had already been gone over an hour.

493
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,323
No.

494
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,158
Nobody seems to know where he went.

495
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,510
Why don't you put an alert out on him,

496
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,814
and I'll check on him from here?

497
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,412
Okay, right.

498
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,957
(soft music)

499
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,356
(cat clattering)

500
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,881
The little fraud.

501
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:11,107
[Officer] Louis Raby.

502
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,316
Age 29.

503
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,318
5'11" tall.

504
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,945
Dark complexion.

505
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:17,321

00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,322
What do you suppose they want here?

518
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,742
You, man, you.

519
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,548
Hey, maybe they're
looking for old Walter.

520
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,703
He's the criminal type.

521
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:08,997
Ain't you, Walter?

522
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,751
Sorry, Mr. De Santis.

523
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,252
That's all right, Walter.

524
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,044
Sit down.

525
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,546
- Who me?
- Sit down.

526
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,133
Greetings, man.

527
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,302
I'm not supposed to
sit with the customers.

528
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,678
Swing!

529
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,847
Why shouldn't you sit
at the table, Walter?

530
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,349
After all, you're a big artist now.

531
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,769
A true creator above mere mortals.

532
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,229
What's the big idea?

533
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,396
Idea?

534
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,067
I was just telling Walter the truth.

535
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,820
A man wanted to pay me $100 for the cat.

536
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,364
In fact, he's taking it
home to show to his wife.

537
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,243
Proves that I underestimated
Walter's ability.

538
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,330
His work has enormous realism.

539
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,248
You can hardly tell it
from the real thing.

540
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,626
Boy, that sounds like a real put-down.

541
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,211
Get off Walter's back, Leonard.

542
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,545
Am I on his back?

543
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,465
You're not very funny.

544
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,925
I'm not trying to be.

545
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,678
Walter, what are you gonna make next?

546
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,556
A dog, maybe.

547
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,723
Or a bird?

548
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,479
How about a few dozen
cockroaches from your room?

549
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:14,313
Hey, man.

550
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,981
Why don't you make an elephant?

551
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,399
I got a new one.

552
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,692
Great.

553
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,859
What is it?

554
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:23,781
It's a full-length, life-size figure.

555
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:24,615
Crazy.

556
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:25,866
What is it called?

557
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,744
Murdered Man.

558
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,622
- When do we get to see it?
- Anytime.

559
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:34,291
Hey, that's a pretty
far-out name for a statue.

560
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,626
I saw a statue once.

561
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,129
It was called, The Third Time
Phyllis Saw Me, She Exploded.

562
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,215
Man, what kind of a statue was that?

563
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,049
I don't know.

564
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,416
It was made out of driftwood
and dipped in fluoric acid.

565
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,095
It was very wild.

566
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,347
(coughing)

567
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,640
What's wrong, Leonard?

568
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,225
Nothing.

569
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,395
It's the food in this dump.

570
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:55,229
Oh, man.

571
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,772
You should try the Sorrel Sewer.

572
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,691
They got wheat germ bagels.

573
00:30:58,858 --> 00:30:59,858
Too much.

574
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,444
Excuse me, please.

575
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,823
I think he really is sick.

576
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,408
So who isn't?

577
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,662
De Santis.

578
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,164
I've been trying to get you all evening.

579
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,082
Gotta make a call.

580
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,750
Gotta call Lieutenant Valdez.

581
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,294
Listen, I was wrong about my wife.

582
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,337
She wants that cat after all.

583
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,171
Do you hear me?

584
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,778
I'll give you that $100 for the cat.

585
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,550
I can't talk to you just now.

586
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,051
All right, then, 200.

587
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,218
No!

588
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,305
No!

589
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,973
$300, and that's tops.

590
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,436
$300 for the cat?

591
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,772
(laughs) I know I'm
going out of my mind,

592
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,649
but I've been collecting art pieces

593
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,152
all over Europe for years, and this boy,

594
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,570
Walter Paisley, has got it.

595
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:45,988
I want to buy his first work.

596
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,240
And to make very sure that I get it,

597
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,034
I'll pay you $500.

598
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,744
$500 for the cat.

599
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,704
And the first look at his next stuff.

600
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,463
Someone has the cat just now,

601
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,381
but I'll have him back in a few days.

602
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,301
Then you can have it for the $500.

603
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:09,553
Oh, thank you, sir.

604
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,055
I think I've made a bargain.

605
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:12,556
Call me when you're ready.

606
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:13,723
Good night.

607
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,102
Leonard.

608
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,563
Feel better?

609
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,024
Listen.

610
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,525
I'm going over to Walter's later,

611
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,778
after the place closes
to see Murdered Man.

612
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,280
You feel up to coming along?

613
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,869

Look at the size of it.

619
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,682
Well, it's not really that big.

620
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,183
I got it on kind of a stand.

621
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:59,061
Let's see it.

622
00:32:59,228 --> 00:32:59,895
I'm a little nervous.

623
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,314
I ain't never did a person before.

624
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,483
You can do anything if
you set your mind to it.

625
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,734
It's hot in here.

626
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,194
You want me to open a window?

627
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:08,112
Come on, Walter.

628
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,405
Take off the sheet.

629
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,827
(ominous music)

630
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:20,833
Don't you like it?

631
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,880
Walter, it's a masterpiece.

632
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,342
I've never seen anything like it before.

633
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,305
And I hope I never see
anything like it again.

634
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:37,849
Neither do I.

635
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,479
It's hideous, and it's eloquent.

636
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,860
It expresses modern man
in all his self-pity.

637
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,572
How did you ever find
that in yourself, Walter?

638
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,323
Well, it wasn't easy.

639
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,287
What's the matter with you?

640
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,538
Nothing.

641
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,456
Nothing at all.

642
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,333
I've never seen anyone so squeamish.

643
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,419
What's your opinion, Leonard?

644
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:06,253
Don't ask me.

645
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,880
Oh, come on.

646
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,882
Even you must see its value.

647
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:11,089
Do you think that you or I

648
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,655
could have conceived of such a thing,

649
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,219
much less executed it?

650
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,764
Well, then admit it.

651
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,640
It's a work of genius.

652
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,808
I admit it.

653
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,896
Then let's take it
down to the Yellow Door.

654
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,731
- No.
- Why not?

655
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:29,151
I'll tell you, but
you cover it up again.

656
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,318
Please, huh?

657
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Please!

658
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,034
Thank you.

659
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,243
What is all this nonsense?

660
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,661
Why do you want to hide it?

661
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,332
Well, I've been thinking.

662
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,878
I didn't realize how much
talent Walter actually had.

663
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:51,924
It would be wrong to show
his pieces one at a time.

664
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,425
Dead wrong.

665
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,010
You're right.

666
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,845
He should build a collection first.

667
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,099
Yes.

668
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,265
That's the idea.

669
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,994
Maybe when it's big
enough, we can have a show.

670
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:03,685
A show?

671
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,229
- Just for me?
- No!

672
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:06,063
Not exactly.

673
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,898
I mean, it would take years and years.

674
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,443
It's getting hot again.

675
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,739
It would take you years
to make that many statues,

676
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,366
but your work would be featured.

677
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,409
It's a wonderful idea, Walter.

678
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,829
It's the only way to gain recognition.

679
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,932
The big art critics and
art dealers will be there.

680
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:24,790
It'll be an event.

681
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,959
Yes, then we could
unload and sell this stuff

682
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,126
for a lot more.

683
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,629
But the show, how soon could we go?

684
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:31,463
Don't rush things.

685
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,630
It takes time.

686
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,675
But first of all, you've
got to stop making

687
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:35,926
these horrible statues.

688
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,388
Carla and I will guide you.

689
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,056
Maybe you can turn to free-form.

690
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:41,890
Free-form?

691
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:42,724
That's the movement today.

692
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,351
With his talent for realism?

693
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,238
You can see the direction
his realism takes.

694
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,187
It's unhealthy.

695
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,856
But you said I was a genius.

696
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,732
I don't wanna be a busboy anymore.

697
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,901
Maybe you got a point there.

698
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,362
You shouldn't keep working
at the Yellow Door.

699
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,196
Look.

700
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,116
I'm sure that man is gonna
buy your dead cat, so here.

701
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,493
Here's your fee in advance, $50.

702
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,705
And if you need more, I've
got it, so don't worry.

703
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:06,748
I've got great faith in you, Walter.

704
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,419
Gee, $50 for something I made.

705
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,296
Now you're a professional.

706
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,462
Let's go.

707
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,632
Okay.

708
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:16,799
Good night, Walter.

709
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,344
Keep up the good work.

710
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,555
Yeah, but don't rush things.

711
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,473
You got all the time in the world.

712
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,017
Come on, Carla!

713
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:25,976
Good night, Walter.

714
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,144
Good night.

715
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,359
Yippee!

716
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,989
Did you holler, Walter?

717
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,741
I'm an artist, Mrs. Swickard.

718
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:41,617
Yeah?

719
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,783
Oh, sure you are, Walter.

720
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:43,868
I am.

721
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,578
Look!

722
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,001
Good heavens!

723
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,425
(singing in foreign language)

724
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,395
One of the greatest
advances in modern poetry

725
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,231
is the elimination of clarity.

726
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,399
I'm proud to say my
poetry is only understood

727
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,276
by that minority which is aware.

728
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,028
Aware of what?

729
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:19,195
Not of anything, stupid.

730
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,238
Just aware.

731
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,744
Man, this place is beginning
to feel like a lineup.

732
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:26,911
Yeah, baby.

733
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,890
If it don't cool off pretty soon,

734
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,083
I'm gonna haunt somebody else's joint.

735
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,960
We may have to start drinking.

736
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:37,631
(singing in foreign language)

737
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,220
- Yes, man, yes.
- (audience applauding)

738
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,347
Yes, that's my man.

739
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,514
Yes.

740
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,768
Yes, man, yes.

741
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,981
Good evening, Walter.

742
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,399
Good evening, Carla.

743
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:02,739
Sylvia, didn't you see
me wave my zen stick?

744
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,491
Why, it's Walter Paisley.

745
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:07,286
Bring me a cappuccino and
a piece of papaya cheesecake

746
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:09,871
and a bottle of Yugoslavian white wine.

747
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,373
Yes, sir, Mr. Paisley.

748
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,540
Good evening, Walter.

749
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,376
Maxwell, how have you been?

750
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,878
I see the rewards of
achievement have come your way.

751
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,424
Well, after all, I'm a
successful sculptor now.

752
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,590
Indeed.

753
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,678
Hey, man, dig Walter the wigger.

754
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,805
He's comin' out like
he just cured cancer.

755
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,932
Let us make the scene.

756
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,184
Crazy.

757
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,936
I was just suggesting to Walter

758
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,604
that he try his hand at free-form.

759
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,440
Why do you suggest anything to Walter?

760
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,317
Are you the spokesman for society,

761
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,944
come to put your stifling
finger in his eye?

762
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,738
Good evening, gentlemen.

763
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,990
Who invited these two
down from the clouds?

764
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:46,158
Maxwell.

765
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,034
Yoo-hoo!

766
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,868
Clear the table.

767
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:48,702
Bring a bowl.

768
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:49,536
I may be sick.

769
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:53,623
It's Alice the awful, come
to spread cheer and cholera.

770
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,042
Look at my suntan, everybody?

771
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,293
Do we have to?

772
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,128
Where have you been, Alice?

773
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,130
I went to Big Bur and
looked for Henry Miller.

774
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:01,506
You didn't find him, I hope.

775
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,383
- No, he's in Europe.
- Good.

776
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,845
Why is the busboy sitting here?

777
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,472
I'm not the busboy anymore.

778
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,306
That's right.

779
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,932
Walter has become a sculptor.

780
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,684
Oh, really?

781
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,311
I'm a model, you know.

782
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,646
I only charge $25 an hour.

783
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,190
Would you like to do me?

784
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,942
I just might.

785
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,109
Never mind that.

786
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,403
Walter's gonna try free-form.

787
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,072
There you go again.

788
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,908
I may take my business
to the Sorrel Sewer.

789
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,494
As a matter of fact, I was
going to suggest to Walter

790
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,579
that he try a female figure

791
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,123
as a change from the violent death theme.

792
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,333
You really should, Walter.

793
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,168
You know what?

794
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,129
If you like, I'll be your model for free.

795
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,296
I couldn't.

796
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,090
Not you.

797
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:44,575
Man, if you're gonna be an artist,

798
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,426
you've gotta do nudes.

799
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,344
Nudes.

800
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:48,178
Right.

801
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:49,012
Right.

802
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:49,846
Right.

803
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,975
Ain't nobody an artist
unless he does nudes.

804
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,161
Will you get them out of here

805
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,020
before we wind up in night court?

806
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,355
Let's change the subject.

807
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,065
I'm sick of hearing about sculpture.

808
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,067
Nobody knows how to do that anymore,

809
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,319
much less the busboy from the Yellow Door.

810
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,571
Who do you think you're talkin' about?

811
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,115
Don't shout at me!

812
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,574
I don't like you.

813
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,121
(laughs) Nobody asked
for your opinion, Walter.

814
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,640
You're just a simple little farmboy,

815
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,500
and the rest of us are all
sophisticated beatniks.

816
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,252
That's all, man.

817
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,419
Let's split.

818
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,212
Yeah, man.

819
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,133
I gotta make me some air.

820
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:28,927
See?

821
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,137
You made them leave.

822
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,555
What did I do?

823
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,558
The first beneficial service
of your benighted life.

824
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,977
It proves we're all good for something.

825
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,563
Are you saying that this
busboy is better than I?

826
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,439
Yes.

827
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,983
I think this whole bit
about him being a sculptor

828
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,026
is just a big put-on for my benefit.

829
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:45,861
That's not true.

830
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:46,862
I am a sculptor.

831
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:48,405
Oh, yeah?

832
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,239
Prove it.

833
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:51,074
Make something out of this.

834
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:51,992
There.

835
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,159
Hand.

836
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,245
That isn't a real hand.

837
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,789
If you were a sculptor, you'd
create something for me.

838
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,667
A harpoon would be very nice.

839
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:01,834
I'm goin' home.

840
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:08,049
Alice, you're obnoxious.

841
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,926
But he's such an idiot.

842
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,804
(knocking on door)

843
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:55,680
Yes?

844
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,307
What are you doing here?

845
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:01,186
I wanted to apologize for
being nasty to you this evening.

846
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,145
So you apologized.

847
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,312
Good night.

848
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,364
(knocking on door)

849
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,156
Listen, twerp.

850
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,176
Why don't you get out of
here and let me go to bed?

851
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,826
I didn't finish talkin' to ya.

852
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,496
I decided to make that
female figure after all.

853
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:20,330
Oh?

854
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,457
I'd like you to pose for it.

855
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:24,459
Remember what I said about my price?

856
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:25,919
$25 an hour.

857
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,089
If you wanna pay it,
I don't mind posing.

858
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,174
When do you wanna start work?

859
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,759
Tonight?

860
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,760
You mean right now?

861
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:34,927
Uh-huh.

862
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,138
Wait till I get my sweater.

863
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,051
You could use a little more
heat around this place.

864
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:16,386
It's bad for the clay.

865
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,471
You'll get used to it.

866
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,686
Well, I'm almost ready.

867
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,815
Here.

868
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,320
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.

869
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,624
Kind of rickety.

870
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,876
How's this pose?

871
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:48,877
Oh, that's fine.

872
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:50,170
It's very good.

873
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:52,756
Just stay like that.

874
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,551
It doesn't look like very much clay.

875
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,428
Oh, it's enough.

876
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,766
Put this around your neck.

877
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:18,281
(choking sounds)

878
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:27,415
Ah, breakfast.

879
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:29,709
Watch it.

880
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,169
The plate's hot.

881
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,712
Are these fertile eggs?

882
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,297
Are these eggs fertile?

883
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,131
Naturally.

884
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,925
What did you fry them in?

885
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,968
We ran out of the safflower seed oil,

886
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,638
but I found a bottle of
peanut oil on the shelf.

887
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,472
Don't worry.

888
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,306
It's not hydrogenated.
(doorbell ringing)

889
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:44,659
Is that the cold-pressed stuff,

890
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,434
or the junk Hilda bought by mistake?

891
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,438
Yes, man, yes.

892
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,272
Hi.

893
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,232
- Good morning, Walter.
- Hi, Walter.

894
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,109
What brings you here?

895
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,152
- Have some breakfast.
- What are you having?

896
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,823
Soy and wheat germ pancakes,
organic guava nectar,

897
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,701
calcium lactate, and tomato
juice, and garbanzo omelets,

898
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,411
sprinkled with smoked yeast.

899
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,287
- Join us?
- No, thanks.

900
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,872
Sounds great, though.

901
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,374
I brought something to show you.

902
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:10,851
Could I have some of the guys help me?

903
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,961
- Is it Murdered Man?
- It's better.

904
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,295
Come on.

905
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,462
Porters.

906
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,721
Put it in the middle of the room.

907
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,055
When did you do this, Walter?

908
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:24,889
Last night.

909
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,216
It doesn't take me very long.

910
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,726
I should say not.

911
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,102
Well, let's see it, man.

912
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,620
Walter, I can't believe it.

913
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,831
I'm honored to know this man.

914
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,125
- Do you think it's nice?
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

915
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,377
Do you think it's
nicer than Murdered Man?

916
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:55,295
I don't know, Walter.

917
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,464
It's impossible to choose.

918
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,215
They're both great.

919
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,342
Walter, I am deeply moved.

920
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,218
To show my appreciation,

921
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,280
I'm going to give a party
tonight at the Yellow Door,

922
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:05,388
in your honor.

923
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:06,806
And I shall compose a poem.

924
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,938
(flamenco guitar music)

925
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,493
Some more champagne, your majesty?

926
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:27,368
Hear, hear.

927
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,078
- Where, where?
- There, there.

928
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,874
That's fine.

929
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,918
Can I just have another little kiss?

930
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,212
Walter, you're a letch.

931
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,378
I am?

932
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,051
Here we go!

933
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,218
Here we go!

934
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:52,727
All right.

935
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,020
All right.

936
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:57,482
Walter, the bird that flies now,

937
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:01,110
pays later through the nose
of ambidextrous apathy.

938
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,446
Necrophiles may dance upon the place mats

939
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,573
in an orgy of togetherness.

940
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,492
The highway of life cuts sharply

941
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,745
through the shady ghettos
and the ivy-covered tombs.

942
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:13,331
And laughter rings from every time capsule

943
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:15,625
in the star-spangled firmament.

944
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:19,045
And in the deep freeze,
it is the children's hour.

945
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,215
And no one knows that Duncan is murdered.

946
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,511
And no one knows that
Walter Paisley is born.

947
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:28,972
Duncan knows.

948
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,349
Tuesday's sunrise knows.

949
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,853
Alley cats and garbage cans
and steaming pavements.

950
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:38,815
And you and I and the nude
descending the staircase

951
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:40,483
and all such things with souls,

952
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,279
we know that Walter paisley is born.

953
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,697
Ring rubber bells.

954
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,073
Beat cotton gongs.

955
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,284
Strike silken cymbals.

956
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,910
Play leathern flutes.

957
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,538
The cats and cans and you and I,

958
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,832
and all such things with souls,

959
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:59,669
we shall hear Walter Paisley is born.

960
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,672
And the souls become flesh.

961
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,258
Walter Paisley is born!

962
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,760
(applauding)

963
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,642
Marvelous, darling.

964
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:15,809
Marvelous.

965
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,857
Man, like, that was the
greatest gas I ever heard.

966
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,609
Crazy, what did he say?

967
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,526
Didn't you hear him?

968
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:24,944
No, man, I'm too far out.

969
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,037
Maxwell, that was magnificent.

970
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,205
I feel so elegant.

971
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:37,474
Walter deserved every word of it.

972
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,667
It makes me so glad I'm aware.

973
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:43,880
Did you hear what he said?

974
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,548
Yes, Walter.

975
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:46,758
All about me.

976
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:49,969
It's true, isn't it?

977
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,095
Every word.

978
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,685
You better hold off
on the bubbly, artist.

979
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,852
Yeah, why?

980
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,981
You might talk too much.

981
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,191
What would I say?

982
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,485
Most anything, I expect.

983
00:49:05,652 --> 00:49:08,237
[Maxwell] Are you two trying
to ignore the rest of us?

984
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,365
Oh, not me, Maxwell.

985
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,325
I wouldn't ignore you.

986
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,953
I know what it is to be ignored.

987
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,246
Tell us what you're
going to do next, Walter.

988
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,915
I'm gonna make the most wonderful,

989
00:49:19,082 --> 00:49:21,501
wildest, wiggiest things you've ever seen.

990
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,505
I'm gonna make big statues
and little statues,

991
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:27,840
tall statues and short statues.

992
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,386
I'm gonna make statues of nobodies

993
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,471
and statues of famous people.

994
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:38,810
Statues of actors and poets.

995
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:41,020
And people who sell things on television.

996
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,815
And a statue of the mayor.

997
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:47,276
And some opera singers and
their intimate friends.

998
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:51,197
And everybody will say,
"Walter, let me shake your hand.

999
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,616
"It's been a real pleasure
to have known you."

1000
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:56,452
Hear, hear.
(applauding)

1001
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,291
Alley cats and garbage cans,

1002
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,545
they know that Walter Paisley is born.

1003
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,255
Ring rubber bells.

1004
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,840
Beat cotton gongs.

1005
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,175
Strike silken cymbals.

1006
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,094
Play leathern flutes.

1007
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,432
Tell us what you're donna do next, Walter.

1008
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:22,186
I'm gonna make big
statues, little statues.

1009
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,648
Movie stars and poets

1010
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:28,276
and guys who sell things on television.

1011
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,988
And the mayor and some opera singers.

1012
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,617
What you gonna do next, Walter?

1013
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:41,748
What am I gonna do next?

1014
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,585
What am I gonna do next?

1015
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,631
I gotta do something before they forget.

1016
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,720
I know what it's like to be ignored.

1017
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,026
Who are you?

1018
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:10,860
What do you want?

1019
00:51:11,027 --> 00:51:12,320
Life is an obscure hobo,

1020
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,405
bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.

1021
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,239
Huh?

1022
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,074
What did you say?

1023
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,159
What is not creation is graham crackers.

1024
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:19,966
Let them all crumble to feed the creator.

1025
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:20,870
Oh, beat it.

1026
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:22,037
You must be nuts.

1027
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,008
No!

1028
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:35,175
No!

1029
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:36,843
No!

1030
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,553
No, no!

1031
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,432
No!

1032
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,851
(screaming)

1033
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,737
Hello, Leonard.

1034
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,156
Beautiful morning, isn't it?

1035
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,323
Was.

1036
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,565
What's that you got in the box?

1037
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,120
Just wait till you see this.

1038
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,163
Extra!

1039
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:04,997
Extra!

1040
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,583
Horrible murder in furniture factory.

1041
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,711
Read about the man who got cut in half.

1042
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:11,671
Extra!

1043
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,047
Extra!

1044
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,841
Police can only find part of him.

1045
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,509
[Walter] Leonard.

1046
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,264
What's the matter, Leonard?

1047
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,227
You made a bust.

1048
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:27,061
Yeah.

1049
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,228
Isn't it wonderful?

1050
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,560
What's the matter, Leonard?

1051
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,816
Put it down, Walter.

1052
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:32,983
Please.

1053
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:40,074
Walter.

1054
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:42,076
Walter, listen to me carefully.

1055
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:44,954
I don't want you to make any more statues.

1056
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:46,164
Do you understand?

1057
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,331
No more statues.

1058
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,583
Well, why not?

1059
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,459
I gotta make statues, Leonard.

1060
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:51,294
You heard Brock.

1061
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,500
They want me to make them.

1062
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,548
If I stop makin' them, I'll
just be a busboy again.

1063
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,382
Brock.

1064
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,302
He's behind all of this with
his stupid, bitter poetry.

1065
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:00,303
Listen.

1066
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,471
You've got to stop and right away.

1067
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,765
I'm beginning to feel responsible.

1068
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:05,641
Why?

1069
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,310
What did you do?

1070
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,476
Never mind.

1071
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,940
Walter, I've decided to have
that show for you right away.

1072
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:15,318
Yes.

1073
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,962
When Carla comes, we'll have her work up

1074
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,529
some nice invitations.

1075
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:20,114
We'll have them printed up.

1076
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:23,326
We'll invite the critics
and the art collectors.

1077
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,619
We'll tell them.

1078
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,334
Well, I don't see why we can't go.

1079
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,128
Mr. Leonard de Santis is
afraid to have you come.

1080
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,672
You, who buy his coffee
and lure his tourists.

1081
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:39,926
You, who are the heart and soul
and meat of the Yellow Door.

1082
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,552
He's slighted you.

1083
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,221
Did you get an invitation?

1084
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,263
I did not.

1085
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,806
But I'm going anyway.

1086
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,101
Not to drink his champagne,
but to see Walter's triumph.

1087
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:50,478
After that, we go no more.

1088
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,730
Hi, Maxwell.

1089
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,607
I won't say, good luck, Walter.

1090
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,483
Why not?

1091
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,250
It would imply that
you could not succeed

1092
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:58,486
on your ability alone.

1093
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,824
You look so handsome.

1094
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,159
I do?

1095
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,326
So do you.

1096
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,080
I mean, you look so pretty.

1097
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:09,914
Thank you.

1098
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,165
Are you ready?

1099
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:12,875
We've got plenty of time.

1100
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,669
I know, but I wanted to talk to you.

1101
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:15,461
Okay.

1102
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,672
We can go now if you like.

1103
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,838
Bye.

1104
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,260
Later, man, later.

1105
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,594
Swing.

1106
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,931
Man, why do you suppose
Walter wants to get her alone?

1107
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,184
Do you suppose he could be
physically attracted to her?

1108
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:31,018
No, man.

1109
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:31,852
He ain't the type.

1110
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,271
He don't get enough Vitamin E.

1111
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:37,483
Maxwell gave him a bottle
of wheat germ oil once.

1112
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,235
Maybe he just started taking it.

1113
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,662
What did you want to
talk to me about, Walter?

1114
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,291
Well, what kind of
people do you like, Carla?

1115
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:59,297
Oh, thinking people,
artistic people, I guess.

1116
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,507
You think I'm artistic?

1117
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:02,508
Of course I do.

1118
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,218
That means you like me.

1119
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,220
I like you very much, Walter.

1120
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,221
I thought you did,

1121
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,148
on account how you kissed
me the other night.

1122
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,019
Oh, that was for your
sculpture of the girl.

1123
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,812
Your Nude in the Chair.

1124
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:18,649
Carla, I've been alone for a long time,

1125
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,984
and I know you been alone

1126
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:21,545
'cause you never seem
to go out with anybody,

1127
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,588
even though Leonard's always
asking you to go out with him.

1128
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,989
And I just...

1129
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,117
What are you trying to say?

1130
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:40,755
Carla, I don't want
to make statues anymore.

1131
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,549
I wanna get married to you.

1132
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:50,264
How long have you been
thinking about this, Walter?

1133
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,350
Oh, for a long time.

1134
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,478
Ever since you first
came to work at the club.

1135
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:58,230
You were the only one
who was ever nice to me.

1136
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,649
I didn't know you loved
me until you kissed me.

1137
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:08,407
Walter, I do like
you and I did kiss you,

1138
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,370
but that was because of your work.

1139
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,042
There's more to being in love
with someone than just that.

1140
00:56:20,503 --> 00:56:22,129
You mean you don't love me?

1141
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,717
I'm afraid that's what I mean.

1142
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:30,513
But you gotta love me.

1143
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,932
Why do you think I made
that statue of Alice?

1144
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,351
Walter, I'm sorry, but...

1145
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,478
You just can't be sorry.

1146
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:38,646
I wanna marry you.

1147
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,815
Now, calm down, Walter,

1148
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:41,981
and let's go in there

1149
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,652
and then maybe when the show's over,

1150
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:45,879
we can talk about it some more.

1151
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,571
Well, I don't wanna talk about it.

1152
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,659
I get it.

1153
00:56:51,826 --> 00:56:53,285
I see the whole thing now.

1154
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:58,541
Nobody knows that Walter Paisley is born.

1155
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:06,132
Carla, will you do one favor for me?

1156
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,468
Just about anything, Walter.

1157
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,848
Would you let me make a statue of you?

1158
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,768
Would you really like to?

1159
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,354
That would make me very happy.

1160
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,355
Okay.

1161
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:24,524
Tonight.

1162
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:28,279
I'll make a statue of you tonight, okay?

1163
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,327
Come on.

1164
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,330
(light jazz music)

1165
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,983
Walter?

1166
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,150
No, thanks.

1167
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,280
This could bring about
a return to realism.

1168
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:13,616
Yes, a one-man return.

1169
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:15,951
We have many artists
about but no craftsmen.

1170
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,662
This man knows his anatomy.

1171
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,499
I'd give 1,500 for this.

1172
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,543
After you read my review,
it'll probably cost you 5,000.

1173
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,007
So, what's the trouble?

1174
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,719
Why should you be so depressed?

1175
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:35,526
Have you heard the things they're saying?

1176
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,224
You can make 25,000 on these pieces alone.

1177
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:39,642
I thought you put money down.

1178
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,144
I do, but 25 thou?

1179
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:43,311
Leave me alone.

1180
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:56,909
Out!

1181
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,869
Man, we have come to make the scene.

1182
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,222
How about some cappuccino, man?

1183
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:00,913
We got the bread.

1184
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,182
We're not open for business.

1185
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,206
This is an art exhibit.

1186
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:03,999
No bums.

1187
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:04,833
Get out!

1188
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,003
- That art is a bum, man.
- Yeah, and he's sober.

1189
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:08,837
That's his problem.

1190
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:09,713
All right, man, alright.

1191
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,548
We'll wait outside.

1192
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:11,714
Yeah, you wait outside.

1193
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,417
Where you goin', Carla?

1194
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:48,669
What's the matter?

1195
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:52,339
Walter, there's a
body inside that statue.

1196
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,091
Oh.

1197
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,258
Oh, that's Alice.

1198
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,220
It's all right, Carla.

1199
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:00,389
Maxwell says it's all right.

1200
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:03,892
"Let them become clay in his
hands that he might mold them."

1201
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,854
Walter, you stay away from me.

1202
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,523
Don't you see, Carla?

1203
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,400
I made them immortal.

1204
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,234
Don't you see?

1205
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:13,441
I can do the same for you.

1206
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:34,340
(screaming)

1207
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:44,600
Call Valdez.

1208
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:45,434
Have him send me some cars.

1209
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:46,268
I'm going after Paisley.

1210
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,435
I'm going with you.

1211
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:49,730
Hey, man, what is the score?

1212
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,065
Walter Paisley's a murderer.

1213
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:54,193
Man, I saw him chasing
Carla down the street.

1214
01:01:42,491 --> 01:01:45,035
[Lou Voiceover] Walter.

1215
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,453
What was that?

1216
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,248
Nobody knows I'm here.

1217
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:50,582
[Lou] Walter.

1218
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:53,335
No.

1219
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:54,670
He couldn't know.

1220
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:55,921
They're dead.

1221
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,927
- How could they know?
- Did you see him?

1222
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,490
[Alice Voiceover] He's
hiding around here someplace.

1223
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:07,714
[Lou Voiceover] He can't
hide just because we're in clay

1224
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:08,808
and he isn't.

1225
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,196
[Alice Voiceover] Walter, go home.

1226
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,032
[Lou Voiceover] He won't
know where else to go.

1227
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,077
[Alice Voiceover] Walter, go home.

1228
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:30,914
Where is he?

1229
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:32,017
(cat screeching)

1230
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,044
What's the matter with you?

1231
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,549
[Lou Voiceover] Walter.

1232
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,467
Walter.

1233
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,598
We'll find him.

1234
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,489
[Alice Voiceover]
We'll have him soon, Lou.

1235
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:18,289
[Lou Voiceover] We'll
teach him he can't murder us

1236
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,399
and get away with it, won't we?

1237
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:24,819
Walter.

1238
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:30,783
Walter.

1239
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,497
What you gonna do now, Walter?

1240
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:44,548
I'll hide where they'll never find me.

1241
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:56,518
There's his room.

1242
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,394
He's gone crazy.

1243
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,186
Paisley!

1244
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,938
Paisley, open up!

1245
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,063
Paisley!

1246
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,162
I suppose he would have
called it Hanging Man.

1247
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:18,749
His greatest work.
