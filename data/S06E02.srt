00:00:00,553 --> 00:00:03,229
Ever since you began
to build your empire,

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,295
you've had a crutch to lean on.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,872
I swear in the name of Almighty God,

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,193
I will take revenge on Tommy Shelby.

5
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:13,270
That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.

6
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:15,011
Perhaps we can meet after you've spoken

7
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:16,807
with your wife's uncle, Jack Nelson.

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,353
Tommy Shelby wants
to do business with Jack Nelson?

9
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:21,393
So, speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

10
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,033
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,

11
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:25,073
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

12
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:26,913
It's Ruby. She's not well.

13
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:28,033
I'm coming home.

14
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:38,820
There will be a war in this
family and one of you will die.

15
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:43,193
You've been too busy to
punish the people that killed her.

16
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,669
How is the family?

17
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:57,417
Daddy.

18
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,177
Hello, Ruby.

19
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:05,713
Come here.

20
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:07,140
Let me see you.

21
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:10,937
I missed you. I missed you.

22
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:13,673
That is a Black Madonna.

23
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:15,473
What presents did you get us, Dad?

24
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:16,913
Son.

25
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,473
She's all better, Tommy.

26
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,640
You came back for nothing.

27
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,617
But I'm glad you're back.

28
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,906
Right, before we do anything else,

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,113
we're going to go for a drive, OK?

30
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:33,633
- Let's go.
- What about me?

31
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:35,153
Yeah, you can come too, come on.

32
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,033
A drive where?

33
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,941
I've asked the driver to take
us to see Dr Robert.

34
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,353
- I want him to have a look at Ruby.
- Why, love?

35
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:45,577
The appointment is in one hour,
you can stay here or you can come.

36
00:01:46,937 --> 00:01:48,260
Right.

37
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,050
Right, let's go.

38

39
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,020
Tommy?

40
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:43,923
Yeah?

41
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,840
It was all good. Everything was clear.

42
00:02:49,657 --> 00:02:50,857
That is a relief.

43
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:54,673
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,545
Driver's bringing the car round.

45
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,987
Daddy.

46
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,670
Hiya.

47
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:04,737
Come here.

48
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,994
When did you last sleep?

49
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,780
Not much since we last spoke
on the phone.

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,610
Well, now you know Ruby's all clear,
you can sleep.

51
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,880
Yeah.

52
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:28,650
Lizzie, I am very happy that
Ruby's results are clear.

53
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:30,367
But still you won't sleep.

54
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:35,210
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

55
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,314
We could be on holiday.

56
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,313
We could be up a mountain in America.

57
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,266
That wouldn't have been possible.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,960
The man I'm dealing with is coming
to London. I need to be there.

59
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:55,366
No escape.

60
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,763
We will escape, Lizzie.
One last deal to be done.

61
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,930
It'll be difficult.
Difficulties are to be expected.

62
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:07,080
This is why I must move
from item to item.

63
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:13,313
Do you feel that?

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,840
Do you feel anything?

65
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:20,714
You know, you talk as if you're
watching everything on a screen.

66
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,850
When we go home. When we go home,

67
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:30,074
we'll give the kids to Frances,
and then you and me will go to bed.

68
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:33,890
And I will be the next item.

69
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,890
- That's how it feels now, Tommy.
- Yeah.

70
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:38,154
Everything on a list.

71
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:47,274
- Hey, baby.
- When are we going home?

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,320
Tommy? Tommy?

73
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:24,314
Tommy? What's happened?

74
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,874
Fuck, fuck.

75
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,194
Fuck.

76
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,810
Tommy. Come here. Come here.

77
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,034
What's happened?

78
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:37,834
Tommy.

79
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,900
It is four years...

80
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,863
...one month and six days

81
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,493
since I had a drink.

82
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,074
My head is clear.

83
00:06:11,554 --> 00:06:12,994
I am myself.

84
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:16,507
Is this the first time?

85
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:21,554
Once on the ship back. Not as bad.

86
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,847
Tommy...

87
00:06:27,034 --> 00:06:28,900
...you need to see a doctor.

88
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,287
I've work to do.

89
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,914
It's the work that's to blame.

90
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,200
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

91
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,994
We're going to keep going till
the Boston business is done.

92
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,207
Then we rest.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,300
Then we Peaky Blinders fucking rest.

94
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:58,820
Comrades, before we
end this planning meeting

95
00:06:58,845 --> 00:07:01,221
and send you out into the rain...

96
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
...we have a surprise.

97
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:07,370
He just arrived back from
a trade mission to America.

98
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,730
He came back early

99
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:12,320
and he has insisted on addressing
you volunteers in person.

100
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:14,730
Comrades,

101
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:16,930
your Labour representative
for South Birmingham,

102
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:18,536
Mr Thomas Shelby MP, OBE.

103
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,677
_

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,700
I bring with me on
the train from London...

105
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,560
...a message from Westminster.

106
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,747
No. No, no, no, not a message.

107
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:58,034
Not a message.

108
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:01,690
An instruction, in fact.

109
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,399
You must be silent.

110
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,946
You must say nothing.

111
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:17,680
Say nothing about the present
situation in this city.

112
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:21,009
Say nothing about hunger.

113
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,170
Say nothing about jobs.

114
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:25,690
Say nothing about pay.

115
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,570
But those in greener pastures,

116
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,448
they may speak.

117
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:33,151
They may raise their voices.

118
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,170
But here in the smoke,
you men and women,

119
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,970
Irish and Italian

120
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:42,380
and English who support
the Socialist cause...

121
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:45,490
And even your socialist cats and
dogs and canaries.

122
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,810
...you must hush.

123
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:54,610
Because the King, and all the King's
horses and all the King's men...

124
00:08:55,765 --> 00:08:57,600
...want you to be silent.

125
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:01,290
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer

126
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:05,130
the cuts in wages and
in welfare and in dignity.

127
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,890
And you must not complain,

128
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,680
because that would be unpatriotic.

129
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:12,610
You soldiers, who have fought in France,

130
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:14,810
you are traitors if you speak up.

131
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:19,290
You veterans of their wars
and their booms and their busts,

132
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:21,610
it is you who must take the blows,

133
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:24,232
and carry the burdens
for the sake of those

134
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:27,250
in greener pastures who bellow at you...

135
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,610
..."Silence".

136
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,370
Well, watch this, comrades.

137
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,034
I will not be silent.

138
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,650
Not this Englishman.

139
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,210
No silence from me.

140
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:50,130
No silence from me,

141
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:53,810
because I have heard your voices
when you come to me

142
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,250
and tell me about
the cries of your hungry children,

143
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:01,210
and I will gather up every
single one of those cries

144
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:05,210
and I will take 'em with me
on the train to Westminster...

145
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,530
...and I will let them out
of the bag in the House of Commons,

146
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:11,610
and let them try to silence that, eh?

147
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,594
Shouldn't that involve
some sharing of the burden?

148
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:35,700
All of us taking
a smaller slice of the cake, eh?

149
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,330
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

150
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:42,400
and makes the cars and melts the metal.

151
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:45,890
And the King, remember him,

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,610
the man who ordered all of this,

153
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,920
shouldn't he be taking some of the cuts?

154
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:53,610
Eh, some of the blows?

155
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:56,490
Some of the pain? No or yes?

156
00:10:56,514 --> 00:10:58,234
YES!

157
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,570
Hush.

158
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:13,050
Hush, you working men and women.

159
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,493
Silence.

160
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,380
Good.

161
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,500
Save your voices.

162
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,949
You are going to need them on
Saturday when we rally together

163
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:27,830
at the Bull Ring Market...

164
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:31,140
...and together, we'll raise the roof,

165
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:33,834
we'll break the damned silence...

166
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:38,330
...and bring down this broken
government.

167
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,822
Tommy, Tommy.

168
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,847
Tommy, Tommy...

169
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:55,866
Thank you.

170
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,207
Laura McKee.

171
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,530
Battalion Commander, Fermanagh IRA.

172
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,810
You missed the first and second act.

173
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:08,068
Thank you for coming, Mr Shelby.

174
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,432
Thank you. Thank you.

175
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,994
The third act was enough.

176
00:12:13,714 --> 00:12:16,010
You both have reasons to hate me

177
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,210
and to want to seek revenge
for the killing of...

178
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:19,434
Sh.

179
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:22,620
Gypsy tradition.

180
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:28,920
We do not mention the name of
the dead in company.

181
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,330
Laura McKee,

182
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,130
in the Shelby family,

183
00:12:37,154 --> 00:12:40,260
business comes before issues
of vengeance.

184
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,714
Our beloved departed would
understand and approve.

185
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,040
Let's go, boys.

186
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,361
Our agreement was we meet
in a crowded place.

187
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,820
No need for crowds.

188
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,007
We need you alive.

189
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,140
After you.

190
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:24,560
You know, Mr Shelby, even though
we've been doing business for a while,

191
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,994
we've never met in person.

192
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,840
You spoke with passion and compassion.

193
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,563
You understand forgiveness

194
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,526
and you drink water.

195
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:43,170
Yet I heard from many reliable sources

196
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:47,114
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

197
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:51,880
"Moral turpitude".

198
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,274
It's a good name for a racehorse.

199
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,770
You don't know what it means?

200
00:13:57,794 --> 00:13:59,200
I know what it means.

201
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,474
It means you fuck people.

202
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,402
Fuck people over. Don't give a fuck.

203
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,090
It means you covet and steal

204
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:10,420
and burn all principles
for the sake of self-interest.

205
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,330
Well, I'm changing, Laura McKee,

206
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,640
and my organisation is also changing.

207
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,280
So, what happened in Boston?

208
00:14:25,474 --> 00:14:27,180
Jack Nelson said no.

209
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,514
Are we accepting "no" as an answer?

210
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:35,610
These are letters written to

211
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,460
and by Jack Nelson
over the last three months.

212
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:52,753
This...

213
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:57,234
This is a private letter from
the President of the United States.

214
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:00,154
Where the fuck did you get this?

215
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,650
My racehorse, Moral Turpitude,

216
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,740
is just one of many in my stables.

217
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,450
Sometimes even now I'll
take her out for a run,

218
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,320
if there is a good cause that
requires her services.

219
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:19,610
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

220
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:23,850
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licenses.

221
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,992
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

222
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,530
He's come to measure the strength of
support for fascism in Britain.

223
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,394
He'll report back to the President.

224
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,754
And how does that help us?

225
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:43,062
In this letter to his son,

226
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:46,540
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

227
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:50,690
In this letter to a friend in Berlin,

228
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:54,900
he says some, erm,
interesting things about Jews.

229
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,730
He's not coming to Europe to find facts.

230
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,720
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

231
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:08,320
And you and I are going
to help him in that task.

232
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,006
I thought you were a socialist.

233
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:18,860
Well...

234
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:20,730
...since I've entered politics,

235
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:23,250
I've learned that
the line doesn't go out from

236
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,330
the middle to the left and the right.

237
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,954
It goes in a circle.

238
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,194
I'll show you.

239
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:34,970
You go far enough left,

240
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,330
eventually you'll meet someone
who has gone far enough right

241
00:16:38,354 --> 00:16:39,994
to get to the same place.

242
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,570
Working-class socialists like me,

243
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:46,730
working-class nationalists like you.

244
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,130
The result?

245
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,126
National Socialism.

246
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,400
And that's me,

247
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,380
in the middle.

248
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:02,100
Just a man trying to make an honest
living in a very dark world.

249
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:08,820
You have friends in Dublin, Laura McKee,

250
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,960
who are actively fighting for
a Fascist Ireland.

251
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,833
And you are acting on their behalf,
ain't you?

252
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,570
When Jack Nelson comes to London,

253
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:24,250
I can give him access to Oswald Mosley

254
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:27,770
and to Fascist sympathisers
in the House of Commons

255
00:17:27,794 --> 00:17:30,354
and the House of Lords,
on both sides of the divide.

256
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,287
Fascism is quite the thing...

257
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,867
...among the very best people.

258
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:42,420
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

259
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:50,642
And you think this will allow us
to ship our merchandise to Boston?

260
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,080
Perhaps.

261
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:55,640
There may be other
benefits for your cause.

262
00:17:57,154 --> 00:18:00,970
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

263
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:03,920
and talk to him about a new "golden age"

264
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,580
and let him put a pin in
the map of Ireland

265
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:08,834
for the President of the United States.

266
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,840
I came to collect
Arthur and put him to bed.

267
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:25,843
I found him in the Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

268
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,834
A friend loves at all times...

269
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,240
...but a brother is born for adversity.

270
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,914
Proverbs 17, 17.

271
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:47,050
I have two brothers in need,
but yours is the more urgent, Tommy.

272
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:48,194
Will you come with me?

273
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:52,714
So, Laura McKee...

274
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,994
...are you going to help me
change the world?

275
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:02,490
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

276
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,554
Never is.

277
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:05,794
Is that a yes or a no?

278
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:10,187
My answer's yes.

279
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:13,673
The answer's always yes.

280
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,914
The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

281
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,896
And tell your friends back home,

282
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,967
Tommy Shelby has changed.

283
00:19:30,474 --> 00:19:31,890
Where is he?

284
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,770
When I found him, the syringe was empty.

285
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:35,427
He was sleeping it off on the cobbles.

286
00:19:35,451 --> 00:19:37,500
Shit, Tommy. Shit.

287
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,583
It's all under control, Ada.

288
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,050
Well, I'm not under fucking control.

289
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:46,770
I'm not you, Tommy,
and I'm not Polly either.

290
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,330
Even though I'm trying to be.

291
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,690
She would have stopped this.

292
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:51,450
We will pull Arthur through this.

293
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,930
I'm not talking about Arthur,
I'm talking about you.

294
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:55,940
I heard everything
you were saying in there.

295
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,566
Ada, this will be the end of it,
do you hear me?

296
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:01,050
This is the way out for all of us.

297
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,690
And along the way, I will be doing good.

298
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:03,747
No, along the way,

299
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,530
you're going to
make yourself a lot of fucking money.

300
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:07,170
All right, fair enough.

301
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:10,290
Any incidental rewards
for my good work will be welcome.

302
00:20:10,314 --> 00:20:11,480
But you will get - your fair share,
sister.

303
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,090
And by being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

304
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,660
I can undermine them.

305
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:18,954
Polly would approve.

306
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:22,302
Beneath all the gold and diamonds,
and fucking,

307
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:24,057
fucking mink and lace,

308
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,650
she was a solid Socialist.

309
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,240
Look, I know it's too late for this,
Tom, but...

310
00:20:36,074 --> 00:20:37,906
...this doorway,

311
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:39,451
this same fucking doorway.

312
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:43,770
We used to come here for Dad's beer

313
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:47,100
and we were so little it took two
of us carry one bucket.

314
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,234
Yeah, I remember.

315
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,970
Look at us now, eh?

316
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,290
Yeah.

317
00:20:58,314 --> 00:20:59,800
Fucking look at us.

318
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,890
Take a good look, Tom,

319
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:04,300
cos one of us isn't going
to be here for long.

320
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:07,720
Fuck, opium and presidents!

321
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:18,394
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

322
00:21:20,954 --> 00:21:22,434
...then I wouldn't blame you.

323
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:26,394
But this is my mission.

324
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:29,514
And I will have no limitations.

325
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,474
Where are you, Tom?

326
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,260
Hm?

327
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,940
My big brother?

328
00:21:41,154 --> 00:21:43,474
You know you used
to stop sometimes and laugh.

329
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:47,380
Do you even remember this place?

330
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,500
You walk into the Garrison like a
stranger and you sip fucking water.

331
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,074
But I'm alive, Ada.

332
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:02,760
Yeah.

333
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:06,973
And you're still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

334
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:11,154
Well...

335
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,560
...I think you might have found it.

336
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:18,914
I have children, Tommy.

337
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:22,834
You have to carry
this bucket on your own.

338
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,570
One brother half-dead in
the rain in Garrison Alley

339
00:22:29,594 --> 00:22:32,080
and the other has no limitations.

340
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,727
I'm expected.

341
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:20,410
âª Dilegua, o notte âª

342
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:24,474
âª Tramontate, stelle... âª

343
00:23:25,634 --> 00:23:28,450
Oh, and Mr Solomons no longer tolerates

344
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,834
the smoking of tobacco in his presence.

345
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:39,130
âª All'alba vincero âª

346
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:43,610
âª Vincero âª

347
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:51,634
âª Vincero! âª

348
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:19,850
I always thought that opera was just
fat people fucking shouting.

349
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,594
Yeah. What do you think now?

350
00:24:26,354 --> 00:24:29,010
I think the sound of a tenor
in full passion

351
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,434
reminds me of the crying
out of Italian soldiers

352
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,874
when they had my bayonet inside them.

353
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,240
Ever since my own death,
I have been somewhat haunted by it.

354
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,114
Dear me.

355
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,530
But instead of fighting
these voices, I decided

356
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:53,290
to write their songs down, y'know,
turn them into an opera of my own.

357
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:54,970
Do not light that.

358
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:58,570
No. No. Were you not told?
I have a condition.

359
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,394
What I was told, Alfie...

360
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,434
...is that you have withdrawn and
that you spend your days alone...

361
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:15,650
...obsessing about opera singers.

362
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,514
Opera's not fucking singing, is it?

363
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:20,970
It's not singing.

364
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:25,730
It is the sound that people make
before words.

365
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:30,650
And I do not allow smoking because
I do need to see fucking clearly,

366
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:32,480
all right?

367
00:25:38,394 --> 00:25:41,250
What, do you sense weakness
in the Israelite?

368
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:43,930
- Not a sense of weakness, no, Alfie.
- Huh.

369
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,900
A certain knowledge of it.

370
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:50,800
Since you have been sat
here... writing your opera...

371
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:56,640
...a member of your family has died.

372
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:00,370
Charles Solomons. Your uncle.

373
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,970
He ran all the narcotics,
bootlegging, prostitution,

374
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:06,250
gambling syndicates out of east Boston.

375
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:09,674
But last January, poor old Charlie,
well...

376
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:14,290
...he was shot in the Cotton Club,

377
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:18,130
in the lavatory, by men that you know.

378
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,393
And yet you did nothing, Alfie.

379
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:29,290
Now my opera is called America.

380
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,890
America is my fucking masterpiece.

381
00:26:32,914 --> 00:26:36,680
The truth is, your uncle is dead.

382
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:41,730
Boston is gone and you,

383
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:44,940
once the big man who ran Camden Town,

384
00:26:45,926 --> 00:26:50,886
now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette.

385
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:55,610
Let alone his fucking life.

386
00:26:55,634 --> 00:27:00,130
- You need favours, Alfie.
- I need a fucking final act, right.

387
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:05,920
Just a final fucking act
for my opera. Yeah?

388
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,500
Alfie, I think I may have written
your final act.

389
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:17,160
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

390
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:47,000
I have five tonnes of pure,
refined opium

391
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:50,154
sitting in one of my warehouses
in Liverpool.

392
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:55,570
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

393
00:27:55,594 --> 00:28:01,250
I have men willing
to distribute it in Toronto,

394
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,800
Quebec, New York and Boston.

395
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:08,530
The income would be immediate
and would shift the balance of power

396
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,954
in Boston back in the favour
of the Solomons family.

397
00:28:19,794 --> 00:28:23,050
In the final act
that I am giving you, Alfie,

398
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:25,874
it is you who takes the revenge.

399
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:30,060
Why would you sell?

400
00:28:31,394 --> 00:28:33,210
The Irish are being difficult.

401
00:28:33,234 --> 00:28:35,490
The Italians are not an option.

402
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,250
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

403
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:40,340
- Pay you with credit?
- No.

404
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:43,010
- Oh.
- I will take property.

405
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:45,900
You own half the warehouses in Camden.

406
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,330
I would take them and knock them
down, build houses

407
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:52,434
- for the needy and the deserving.
- Oh.

408
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,770
Yeah, well, the, erm...

409
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:03,770
The Irish have always been
difficult, Tommy, ain't they?

410
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:06,810
For about fucking 700 years.

411
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:11,930
You know that I once saw
an Irishman arguing

412
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:16,330
with the statue of Oliver Cromwell
in Parliament Square.

413
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,410
The argument went on for quite
a while, actually.

414
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,570
It went into the night and his
little voice echoed all around

415
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,050
the Houses of Parliament as he got more

416
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:28,370
and more angered at
Oliver Cromwell's reluctance

417
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,290
on what to answer his legitimate
questions.

418
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:34,055
So angered, in fact, that eventually

419
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,548
he punched the statue on the nose

420
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:40,394
and broke his fucking hand.

421
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:45,880
And there it is, y'know.
The Irish question, innit.

422
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:51,730
How come you can remember so much
about what happened 200 years ago,

423
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:55,194
but you just can't remember
what fucking happened last night?

424
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,260
How much is a tonne?

425
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:07,640
Johnny.

426
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,634
Only me today.

427
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,610
Jack says a few more weeks...

428
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,514
- ...Then you'll be free.
- When do you travel to London?

429
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,620
Tomorrow.

430
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:36,086
I came to say goodbye.

431
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,860
When you go to London,
stay away from the devil.

432
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,180
Block your fucking ears if you have too.

433
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,980
I will be with you, Michael.

434
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:01,900
I've been thinking about you.

435
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,074
Only you.

436
00:31:11,034 --> 00:31:13,594
And don't worry about Tommy Shelby.

437
00:31:16,286 --> 00:31:18,620
I have no interest in a dead man.

438
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:24,530
Jack says he has to die.

439
00:31:24,554 --> 00:31:26,620
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

440
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:29,130
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby...

441
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,280
It will be you. I know.

442
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,300
I told Jack.

443
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:40,180
And Jack said, "OK. Let the kid do it."

444
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:46,314
And in return, he can collect
the cash that Tommy won't.

445
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:51,874
Five million dollars.

446
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:55,480
The devil will be dead.

447
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:58,800
The future belongs to us.

448
00:32:00,273 --> 00:32:02,873
Oh, and, erm, Michael.

449
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:07,127
Every night...

450
00:32:08,114 --> 00:32:10,514
...midnight in Boston, 5am in London...

451
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:15,380
...I'll be wide awake in my big
wide bed,

452
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,960
and you'll be wide awake
in this prison cell.

453
00:32:21,354 --> 00:32:25,060
And our souls will come together,
and we'll fuck.

454
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:29,074
I won't need an alarm clock.

455
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,410
And you won't sleep until I'm done.

456
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,274
Midnight fucks 5am.

457
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:42,794
Every day.

458
00:32:46,114 --> 00:32:48,394
Because we trust each other.

459
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:50,794
Hm.

460
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:30,394
You're a traitor, Shelby!
You're a fucking scab!

461
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:46,573
Darker.

462
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:49,420
Bluer.

463
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,040
Sharper.

464
00:33:52,954 --> 00:33:54,760
And also from below.

465
00:33:55,874 --> 00:33:57,520
Darling, how is that?

466
00:33:58,274 --> 00:34:01,274
You look absolutely terrifying, my love.

467
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,474
Fuck lipstick.

468
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,600
Fun.

469
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,293
To launch the ship.

470
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:35,100
A long and terrible journey, Diana.

471
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,274
Don't fucking let me down.

472
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:50,530
Mr Shelby! Mr Shelby! Daily Mirror.

473
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:51,970
Off!

474
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:55,890
May I ask why a socialist MP
would attend a Fascist rally, sir?

475
00:34:55,914 --> 00:34:58,040
Let him in, let me answer the question.

476
00:34:59,234 --> 00:35:01,530
Mr Mosley's constituency borders my own.

477
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:03,010
We have worked together in the past.

478
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,130
He was once a socialist himself.

479
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:09,250
My role here tonight
is to... to act as a bridge

480
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,370
between ideologies.

481
00:35:11,394 --> 00:35:12,673
I am in the middle.

482
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:16,730
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

483
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:18,941
Will you be sharing the
stage with him tonight?

484
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:22,490
No. I am simply here to remind my friend
Mr Mosley

485
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:24,900
that the way of the British people
is compromise.

486
00:35:25,554 --> 00:35:27,320
And you can print that, pal.

487
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,074
Fucking rag.

488
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,890
Lizzie, you should know Mosely's
wife died six months ago.

489
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:44,370
Give him your condolences, will you?

490
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,290
Tonight, he will be with his mistress.

491
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,474
Who is apparently
a Lady of some standing...

492
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:54,914
...and has given him great comfort
in his time of grief.

493
00:35:56,034 --> 00:35:59,330
Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

494
00:35:59,354 --> 00:36:02,880
- Move out of my fucking way.
- What is Arthur doing here?

495
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:05,770
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

496
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:09,674
Arthur made me a promise,
which he appears to have broken.

497
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,700
Move. I said fucking move.

498
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:17,330
I tried my best.

499
00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:19,890
- He hid some junk in his sock.
- OK.

500
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,111
Move along.

501
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:23,930
Oi.

502
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:26,210
- Tommy Boy.
- Come on. Get in. Get in. Come on.

503
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:29,410
Tom, tell them to fuck off. My brother.

504
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:32,330
Tommy. Johnny Dogs.

505
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:36,210
Mosely invited me.
He said wear a black fucking shirt.

506
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:39,810
I said I would look like every other
bastard.

507
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,890
- Lizzie.
- Come on. For fuck's sake.

508
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:45,730
You're an angel.
I know I've fucking let you down.

509
00:36:45,754 --> 00:36:48,130
I've fucking let you down,
I know I have. All right?

510
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:51,170
I've fucking said sorry a million
times and I'll say it again.

511
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:52,776
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Yeah?

512
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,250
I'm fucking sorry. Look at Johnny Dogs.

513
00:36:55,274 --> 00:36:57,850
Fucking look at the state of him.

514
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:59,800
He looks like a fucking waiter.

515
00:36:59,824 --> 00:37:02,410
- Oh, Shut up.
- Get me a fucking drink.

516
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:05,050
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

517
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:06,490
For fuck's sake, Tommy.

518
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:08,700
Take your fucking shirt
off and give it me now.

519
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,250
Get it off!

520
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:13,280
Arthur, this is my fault.

521
00:37:13,914 --> 00:37:15,730
- This is my fault.
- Yeah.

522
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:19,290
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade?

523
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:21,094
- You voted no.
- I said no.

524
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,490
Remember, I overruled you.

525
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,450
- I've not been here, I've been away.
- Where have you been, Tom?

526
00:37:26,474 --> 00:37:28,475
Ada tells me you've been hanging
out with Mosely?

527
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:29,974
- Yeah, he's...
- Yeah?

528
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,290
Yeah,
in his big beautiful fucking house.

529
00:37:32,314 --> 00:37:34,770
Had parties there in Belgravia.

530
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,210
And they give me fucking respect.

531
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:40,130
And what do you give them?
Snow and junk from the company.

532
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,342
Look at you, brother.

533
00:37:42,366 --> 00:37:44,850
Half of you has gone.
Half of you has gone.

534
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,714
- The fuck!
- Rag and bone.

535
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,520
You fucking slapped me.

536
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,840
You slapped me.

537
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:59,050
I have to remain unresolved.
Do you understand?

538
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,330
Unresolved. Unresolved in everything.

539
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,810
I have to move between left
and right, light and shade.

540
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,850
And maintain the trust of both.

541
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:09,530
And I cannot have my brother wearing
a fucking black shirt

542
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:11,250
on the cover of the Daily Mirror.

543
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:13,250
If anyone takes my picture in this,

544
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,490
they'll find their fucking camera
under my heel, Tom.

545
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:18,450
They are throwing petrol bombs out
there Tommy.

546
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:20,410
I thought Ada was taking care of you.

547
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:23,090
Ada's got decisions to make about
working with us.

548
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,970
- She doesn't know what she wants.
- I'll speak to Ada.

549
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:30,060
- Listen, I'm going home, all right?
- No. You stay there.

550
00:38:30,794 --> 00:38:32,240
I have something for you.

551
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:35,210
Lizzie, you go with Johnny.
Johnny, take Lizzie to her seat.

552
00:38:35,234 --> 00:38:36,690
I don't have an invitation, Tom.

553
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,490
You're wearing a fucking black
shirt, you can do what you like.

554
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:41,440
Go on. I'll follow you. Go on.

555
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:46,834
Go on, Dogs. Get me a fucking drink
while you're there.

556
00:38:51,854 --> 00:38:53,390
I know, Tom. Look at me.

557
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:57,940
Arthur, before I went to America
I wrote a letter.

558
00:38:58,474 --> 00:39:00,090
Yeah? Who to?

559
00:39:00,114 --> 00:39:01,634
To Linda.

560
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,940
And in that letter I wrote,

561
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:10,140
"Linda, as a Christian woman,

562
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,547
"do you believe in forgiveness?"

563
00:39:15,674 --> 00:39:19,914
And this is what I got back.
Two days ago. Have a look.

564
00:39:29,874 --> 00:39:34,010
"As a Christian woman, I do believe
in forgiveness."

565
00:39:34,034 --> 00:39:36,780
Yeah, and the word "do" is underlined.

566
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:42,400
Arthur, I am no Christian.

567
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,114
But I also believe in forgiveness.

568
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,960
So, get yourself clean.

569
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:53,234
Stay clean for two weeks,
I'll write Linda another letter.

570
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,300
Cos I know where she is.

571
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:03,560
First, I need you back.

572
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
I need my brother.

573
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:09,800
Got a lot to do.

574
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,890
Need someone to do the real work.

575
00:40:11,914 --> 00:40:13,611
Yeah.

576
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,610
Yeah. Look at your smile, Tom.

577
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,890
Look at your smile, brother.
It's been so long.

578
00:40:18,914 --> 00:40:21,874
Come on. Let's see what this bastard
has to say. Come on.

579
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:24,549
- All right. All right.
- Come on. Come on.

580
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,090
Yeah, I'm coming.

581
00:40:26,114 --> 00:40:28,490
He is a bastard and all, Tommy.

582
00:40:28,514 --> 00:40:32,210
Black shirts and Jews.
Here we go. Here we fucking go.

583
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:37,090
Stay in the middle and do nothing, Tom.

584
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:39,250
But not fucking me.

585
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:41,530
Come here you, you Nazi bastard.

586
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:42,951
- Oof!
- Ugh!

587
00:40:50,474 --> 00:40:51,954
You! You!

588
00:40:57,394 --> 00:41:00,010
Come here, man,
I'll take your fucking eye.

589
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:01,131
Not here. Not here.

590
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,770
Come here. You've had your fun,
let's go home.

591
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:08,771
We have business.

592
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:14,890
Johnny, you get him home.

593
00:41:14,914 --> 00:41:17,580
This time, check his fucking socks.

594
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:25,320
For fuck's sake.

595
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:33,810
Tommy, we should get out now.
Forget this American business.

596
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,130
We've got enough.

597
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,570
Not yet enough. Here she comes.

598
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:40,994
- Remember to smile. Come on.
- Shit.

599
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:52,690
Ladies and gentlemen,

600
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:55,610
tonight he has truly earned
your adulation.

601
00:41:55,634 --> 00:41:58,610
The future Prime Minister
of this great country,

602
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:00,211
Sir Oswald Mosley.

603
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,791
Fuck you, Mosley.

604
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:40,690
- Fuck. I look terrible.
- You look beautiful, Lizzie.

605
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:42,210
I need to impress this woman,

606
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:44,234
so I will act as if she is
beautiful as well.

607
00:42:45,594 --> 00:42:46,994
Mosely.

608
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:55,130
Diana, this is Tommy Shelby MP, OBE.

609
00:42:55,154 --> 00:42:57,290
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

610
00:42:57,314 --> 00:43:00,210
Oswald's most recent
and last-ever mistress.

611
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:03,290
- This is my wife. Lizzie Shelby.
- Beautiful earrings.

612
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,210
Oh, I stole them from Tiffany's.

613
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:07,610
Actually,
he bought the earrings in Paris.

614
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:10,450
- We were in Paris on our honeymoon.
- God, I hate Paris.

615
00:43:10,474 --> 00:43:12,890
Hmm. I hear you prefer Berlin.

616
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:15,253
Oswald and I are going to marry there,
aren't we, Oswald?

617
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:16,251
Hm.

618
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:19,410
Mosely, I have business to discuss.

619
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:22,970
Perhaps you and I could find
somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

620
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,170
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

621
00:43:27,194 --> 00:43:29,450
that we men go off and discuss business

622
00:43:29,474 --> 00:43:31,570
while you women wait around
looking glamorous.

623
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,770
Goodness.

624
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:36,810
What year do you think this is,
Mr Shelby? 1807?

625
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:39,740
In Birmingham, the centuries
grind by quite slowly.

626
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,050
But, Mr Shelby, if it's business,

627
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:45,410
Diana is the engine of my enterprise.

628
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,370
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

629
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:50,250
Yes, we know. I am company director.

630
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,090
I will join the meeting as well.

631
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:54,450
But of course,
you must come as well, Elizabeth.

632
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:56,798
By the way, I really don't like
"Lizzie".

633
00:43:56,822 --> 00:44:00,570
I prefer Liberated Elizabeth.
She must be part of this.

634
00:44:00,594 --> 00:44:03,930
She's been all the way to Paris, so
she is a woman of the world. Bravo.

635
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:07,274
Do you know, Oswald has told me
everything about you.

636
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:24,490
Only three, because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

637
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:26,730
Our friend in Berlin doesn't either.

638
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:28,570
They have that in common at least.

639
00:44:28,594 --> 00:44:31,034
Oh, I imagine they have lots in common.

640
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:35,900
Report to me, Shelby.

641
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:39,994
Officially Jack Nelson is in London
to buy import licences.

642
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:46,850
And unofficially,
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

643
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,940
Well, as you can see from this
private letter,

644
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,640
he is far from a neutral point of view.

645
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,930
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

646
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:03,040
"Individually Jews are fine
but as a race they stink."

647
00:45:03,914 --> 00:45:04,881
Hm.

648
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:08,170
Elizabeth,
do you even know why the bridge

649
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:10,920
to President Roosevelt is so important?

650
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:16,050
Actually, no.

651
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:19,114
I don't really know much about this
business at all.

652
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:26,170
But I have fucked your future husband.

653
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:28,234
So, I know lots of things about him.

654
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,940
Tommy, I'll be outside.

655
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,780
Well done, Elizabeth.

656
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:42,040
Do you people want to meet Nelson or no?

657
00:45:43,114 --> 00:45:46,690
Mr Shelby, from now on,
can I call you Thomas?

658
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,250
If you like.

659
00:45:48,274 --> 00:45:49,730
Of course we would.

660
00:45:49,754 --> 00:45:52,200
And we are very grateful
for your efforts.

661
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:57,370
But, Mr Shelby, before this
enterprise goes any further,

662
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,820
you really must do
something about your wife.

663
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:29,560
Mr Shelby.

664
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,610
Yes.

665
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:33,210
Mr Nelson.

666
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,540
I came early.

667
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:39,040
I wanted to come and take a look
around this beautiful church.

668
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,200
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby.

669
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:48,010
I hoped that by suggesting we meet
in church it might make us both

670
00:46:48,034 --> 00:46:51,880
more cautious with lies and truth.

671
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:54,514
Well, your hope would be forlorn.

672
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:59,849
- There ain't no-one listening here.
- You don't believe in God?

673
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:01,594
No.

674
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:06,690
It was the way Catholics were
treated in my country

675
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:08,674
that made me angry.

676
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:11,754
Made me what I became.

677
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:17,340
What made you angry?

678
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:23,280
Slowness in anything.

679
00:47:24,954 --> 00:47:27,914
I wanted to have everything already.

680
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:33,074
Two working-class Catholic boys.

681
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:39,160
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

682
00:47:39,994 --> 00:47:42,300
Some man in the shadows.

683
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,290
I carried a screwdriver and a blade.

684
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,010
And everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

685
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,690
And do you?

686
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:53,554
Yes, I do.

687
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:58,714
First man I killed was a priest.

688
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:01,880
You?

689
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:07,170
A Prussian boy with green eyes,
he was already underground.

690
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:09,794
When did you last kill a man, Mr Shelby?

691
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,794
Four years ago.

692
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:20,300
His name was Tommy Shelby.

693
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:22,634
He drank whisky.

694
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:29,810
You want me to allow you
to enter my city

695
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,434
and deal narcotics that will
kill people?

696
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:39,280
You deal in whisky, Mr Nelson.

697
00:48:40,714 --> 00:48:43,730
I recently read a report
by the Vatican, actually,

698
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,755
which said that whisky
disproportionately kills

699
00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:49,210
more of our Catholic brothers
and sisters,

700
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:52,570
whereas opium is the sedative

701
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:56,514
more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

702
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:02,730
In return, there are people in
England who you think I should meet?

703
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:05,554
Yes. Yes, like minds.

704
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:12,220
I'm here to buy import licences
for booze.

705
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,860
The booze of the blue blood elite.

706
00:49:17,194 --> 00:49:18,810
In America, we like...

707
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:22,370
...we like labels and aspiration.

708
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:26,850
Well, I have a brand of my own
vodka and gin.

709
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:29,080
You can add that to your portfolio.

710
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:33,330
I hear Shelby labels are favoured
by the working class.

711
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:36,370
Indeed. A fact of which I am very proud.

712
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:39,850
They say you are a poet, too.

713
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:42,074
No, I only read it.

714
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:48,114
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

715
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:52,970
Fascists.

716
00:49:52,994 --> 00:49:57,354
Not the ones in boots and black
shirts. The ones in tuxedos.

717
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:01,500
I know men who are friends of the cause.

718
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,354
I also know men who are enemies
of the cause.

719
00:50:05,674 --> 00:50:06,890
For many years now,

720
00:50:06,914 --> 00:50:08,890
I have been working closely with
Winston Churchill,

721
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:10,770
in many different capacities.

722
00:50:10,794 --> 00:50:12,580
I have his trust.

723
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:15,490
He's opposed to the rise of fascism.

724
00:50:15,514 --> 00:50:18,434
You, I believe, see it as inevitable.

725
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:24,040
Well, I can give you men
of influence who support your cause.

726
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:28,434
I can also offer you a full report
on Churchill's strategies.

727
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:35,240
All this in return for access
to south Boston.

728
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,730
Alternatively,

729
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:40,250
you can take on Churchill on your own,

730
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:42,140
without my intelligence.

731
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:45,034
And I can sell my opium to the Jews.

732
00:50:49,634 --> 00:50:52,034
You are a brave man, Mr Shelby.

733
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:55,594
A war hero, I hear.

734
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,690
Every war hero I ever met,
they're just someone

735
00:50:59,714 --> 00:51:01,794
who wanted to get themselves killed.

736
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,600
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

737
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,120
I'll think a great deal about
what you've said.

738
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:31,840
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

739
00:51:47,027 --> 00:51:48,500
Ruby?

740
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,220
Ruby?

741
00:51:56,853 --> 00:51:58,773
Ruby?

742
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:03,274
Ruby?

743
00:52:04,594 --> 00:52:06,380
What are you doing, love?

744
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,820
I can hear voices.

745
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:11,954
Coming from up the chimney.

746
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:18,114
- What voices?
- The grey man.

747
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,610
Gentlemen, Mr Thomas Shelby.

748
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:27,268
Birmingham South.

749
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,290
Mr Speaker.

750
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,930
I was raised in a family

751
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:35,850
that endured living conditions
that would test

752
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:38,520
the morality of even the most virtuous.

753
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:43,730
Indeed... Indeed, even the best of
us would have our virtues trounced

754
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:46,290
and thwarted by life in the meanness

755
00:52:46,314 --> 00:52:49,290
and the bitterness of
an overcrowded British slum.

756
00:52:49,314 --> 00:52:51,754
What would you know about virtue?

757
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,960
Quickly, please.

758
00:53:01,674 --> 00:53:05,250
Therefore, Mr Speaker, I intend
to put before this House

759
00:53:05,274 --> 00:53:10,850
a bill which will offer radical
reform in housing in this country,

760
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:14,770
in which slums are cleared
and new houses are built

761
00:53:14,794 --> 00:53:18,360
with new standards
in health and hygiene.

762
00:53:21,794 --> 00:53:25,650
Westminster 245. House of Commons.

763
00:53:29,754 --> 00:53:33,610
The time has come for change,
the people have had enough.

764
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:36,890
Let's open the windows,
let in new light,

765
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:41,410
build a new Jerusalem
brick by Government-owned brick.

766
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:49,011
Into there.

767
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:00,394
Doctor?

768
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:05,953
Yeah, Westminster 245.

769
00:54:09,867 --> 00:54:11,827
Mr Shelby.

770
00:54:30,554 --> 00:54:33,770
Tickner Maura O Beng,
O Beng over and over again.

771
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:36,330
- How is the family?
- And one of you will die.

772
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:39,890
- They are staring at me, Daddy.
- A man with green eyes.

773
00:54:39,914 --> 00:54:42,074
Can you stop the voices?

774
00:54:43,754 --> 00:54:46,060
There are no voices, my love.

775
00:54:46,474 --> 00:54:48,460
It's the grey man.

776
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:51,434
He says he's coming for me...

777
00:54:52,474 --> 00:54:54,640
...and he's coming for Daddy as well.

778
00:55:17,994 --> 00:55:19,091
Argh!

779
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:24,490
Argh!

780
00:55:30,234 --> 00:55:31,580
Argh!

781
00:55:38,394 --> 00:55:40,010
Argh!

782
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,171
Argh!

783
00:55:57,635 --> 00:55:58,874
Argh!

784
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:12,840
Mr Shelby. Is everything
all right in there?

785
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:17,610
Mr Shelby?

786
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,360
Everything's fine.

787
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,967
Everything's fine.

788
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:35,930
- Hello?
- Tommy.

789
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:38,930
Tommy, she has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

790
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:40,128
Just get here now.

791
00:56:40,152 --> 00:56:41,450
- Lizzie.
- Please.

792
00:56:41,474 --> 00:56:42,700
Lizzie.

793
00:57:06,434 --> 00:57:09,274
- Where is she?
- She's with the doctor upstairs.

794
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:13,000
Listen, Tommy.

795
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:15,930
He said we shouldn't come close
to her, in case...

796
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:17,930
In case of what?

797
00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:19,874
When she coughs, there's blood.

798
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,810
Madonna,

799
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:44,314
put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby Lee.
