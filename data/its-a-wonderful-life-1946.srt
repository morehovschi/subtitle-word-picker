1
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,404
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,698
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:33,118
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,829
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,915
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,626
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,461
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:44,713
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,132
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,342
I love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:51,303
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,096
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,473
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:57,851
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:58,436 --> 00:01:59,978
Please bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,272
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,941
Please bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,864
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:13,533
Looks like we'll have
to send someone down.

20
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:16,703
A lot of people asking for help
for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:16,787 --> 00:02:18,330
George Bailey?

22
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,874
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night.
You're right.

23
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,835
We'll have to send someone down
immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,254
That's why I came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,924
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:32,260
Oh, Clarence.
Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:34,221
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,766
Because, you know, sir,
he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,311
Yes, but he's got
the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,438
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,109
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:51,238
Yes, Clarence.
A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,906
Splendid. Is he sick?

34
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,200
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:57,869
At exactly 10:45 p. M. Earth time,

36
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,996
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,040
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:05,752
Oh, dear, dear, his life?
Then I've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,045
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,257
You will spend that hour
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

41
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,343
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

42
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,888
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

43
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:19,432
I've been waiting
for over 200 years now, sir,

44
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,059
and people are beginning to talk.

45
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,602
What's that book you've got there?

46
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,854
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

47
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,315
Clarence, you do a good job
with George Bailey

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,733
and you'll get your wings.

49
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:30,568
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

50
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:33,405
Poor George. Sit down.

51
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,614
Sit down? What are we...

52
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,408
If you're going to help a man,

53
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:38,827
you want to know something about him,
don't you?

54
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,412
Well, naturally, of course. I...

55
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,788
Now, keep your eyes open.

56
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,790
See the town?

57
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:46,543
Where? I don't see a thing.

58
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,462
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't got your wings yet.

59
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:52,507
Now, look, I'll help you out.
Concentrate.

60
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:54,968
Begin to see something?

61
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,762
Why, yes. This is amazing.

62
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:00,432
If you ever get your wings,
you'll see all by yourself.

63
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,267
Oh, wonderful.

64
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,061
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,147
Okay, boys, let's go.

66
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,898
Hey, who's that?

67
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,817
That's your problem. George Bailey.

68
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:11,985
A boy?

69
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,113
That's him when he was 12
back in 1919.

70
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:18,575
Something happens here
you'll have to remember later on.

71
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,994
Come on, Marty.

72
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,912
Let's go, Marty!

73
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,248
Attaboy, Marty.

74
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,751
Hee-haw!

75
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,794
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

76
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:35,008
Here comes the scare-baby,
my kid brother Harry Bailey.

77
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,801
I'm not scared.

78
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,304
Come on, Harry.

79
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:41,348
Let's go, Harry!

80
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:44,017
Come on, Harry!

81
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,102
- Come on, Harry!
- Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:48,188
Help, George, help!

83
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:49,397
Help!

84
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:52,984
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

85
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,362
- Help!
- Hang on, Harry!

86
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,906
- Help.
- Make a chain, gang.

87
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,492
George saved his brother's life that day,

88
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,287
but he caught a bad cold
which infected his left ear.

89
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:06,915
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

90
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,292
It was weeks
before he was able to go back

91
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,754
to his after-school job
at old man Gower's drugstore.

92
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:14,631
Mr. Potter.

93
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:17,008
Who's that, a king?

94
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,010
That's Henry F. Potter,

95
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:22,472
the richest and meanest man
in the county.

96
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:28,978
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

97
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,398
Go to work, slave.

98
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,609
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

99
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,029
Wish I had a million dollars.

100
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:39,906
Hot dog!

101
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,703
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

102
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:46,746
You're late.

103
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,164
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:57,799
Hello, George.

105
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,426
Hello, Mary.

106
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,094
Hello, Violet.

107
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:02,762
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

108
00:06:02,847 --> 00:06:04,180
She was here first.

109
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:06,099
I'm still thinking.

110
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:07,267
Shoelaces?

111
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:08,935
Please, Georgie.

112
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,603
I like him.

113
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:12,439
You like every boy.

114
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:14,149
What's wrong with that?

115
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,733
Here you are.

116
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:17,777
Help me down?

117
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,737
Help you down?

118
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,288
Made up your mind yet?

119
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,123
I'll take chocolate.

120
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:32,917
- With coconuts?
- I don't like coconuts.

121
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,961
You don't like coconuts?

122
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:38,465
Say, brainless, don't you know
where coconuts come from?

123
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:40,467
Lookit here.

124
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:43,761
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands,
the Coral Sea.

125
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:47,307
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

126
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,893
Of course you never.
Only us explorers can get it.

127
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:54,397
I've been nominated for membership
in the National Geographic Society.

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,817
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

129
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:01,654
George Bailey,
I'll love you till the day I die.

130
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,657
I'm going out exploring someday.
You watch.

131
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:07,994
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems
and maybe three or four wives.

132
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:09,329
Wait and see.

133
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,710
- George. George!
- Yes, sir?

134
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,254
You're not paid to be a canary.

135
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,881
No, sir.

136
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:50,245
Mr. Gower, do you want something?
Anything?

137
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,454
No.

138
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:54,791
- Anything I can do back here?
- No.

139
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,709
I'll get them, sir.

140
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:59,587
Quick, take those capsules
over to Mrs. Blaine.

141
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,006
She's waiting for them.

142
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,424
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,116
They have the diphtheria there,
haven't they, sir?

144
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,284
Yeah.

145
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,160
Is it a charge, sir?

146
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:32,829
Yes, George.

147
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:34,497
Mr. Gower, I...

148
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:37,000
- Oh, get going.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,695
Avast there, Captain Cook.
Where you heading?

150
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,239
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
- Some other time, George.

151
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:10,116
- It's important.
- There's a squall in there.

152
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,701
It's shaping up into a storm.

153
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,911
- Uncle Billy, telephone.
- Who is it?

154
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,247
- Bank examiner.
- Bank examiner?

155
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:18,541
I should have called him yesterday.

156
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,251
Switch it inside.

157
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:23,963
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

158
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,882
Well, you're begging.
That's a whole lot worse.

159
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,759
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

160
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:29,135
- Pop.
- Just a minute, Son.

161
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:31,888
Just 30 short days.
I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

162
00:09:32,056 --> 00:09:33,389
- Shove me up, shove me up.
- Pop.

163
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,308
- Just a minute.
- Have you put any real pressure

164
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,810
on these people of yours
to pay those mortgages?

165
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,229
Times are bad, Mr. Potter.
A lot of these people are out of work.

166
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,397
Well, then, foreclose.

167
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,149
I can't do that.
These families have children.

168
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,776
- Pop.
- They're not my children.

169
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,778
But they're somebody's children,
Mr. Potter.

170
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,405
Are you running a business
or a charity ward?

171
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,616
- Well, all right...
- Not with my money.

172
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,285
Mr. Potter, what makes you
such a hard-skulled character?

173
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,204
You have no family, no children.

174
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,164
You can't begin
to spend all the money you've got.

175
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:01,501
I suppose I should give it
to miserable failures

176
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,796
like you and that idiot brother of yours
to spend for me.

177
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,089
He's not a failure!

178
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:09,008
- You can't say that about my father.
- George, George. Quiet, George.

179
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:10,426
You're not.
You're the biggest man in town...

180
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,011
- Run along, run along.
...bigger than him,

181
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:14,263
- bigger than everybody.
- Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

182
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,099
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

183
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,850
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

184
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,686
I'll talk to you tonight.

185
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,027
What?

186
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:31,447
Why, that medicine should have
been there an hour ago.

187
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:34,492
It will be over in five minutes,
Mrs. Blaine.

188
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,707
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

189
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,417
I... You...

190
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,585
Didn't you hear what I said?

191
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,753
Yes, sir. I...

192
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:48,339
What kind of tricks
are you playing anyway?

193
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,094
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

194
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:54,721
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

195
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,264
You're hurting my sore ear.

196
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:57,932
You lazy loafer.

197
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,934
Mr. Gower,
you don't know what you're doing.

198
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,894
You put something wrong
in those capsules.

199
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,229
I know you're unhappy.

200
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,022
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

201
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:06,941
You put something bad
in those capsules.

202
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,360
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

203
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,821
Just look and see what you did.

204
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,490
The bottle you took the powder from,
it's poison.

205
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:16,284
I tell you, it's poison.

206
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,202
I know you feel bad.

207
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:25,293
- Oh!
- Don't hurt my sore ear again!

208
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:29,422
- Don't hurt my sore ear again.
- Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

209
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:32,341
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

210
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,801
I know how you're feeling.

211
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:36,554
I won't ever tell a soul.
Hope to die, I won't.

212
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,514
Oh, George. George.

213
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:41,434
An overnight bag.
Genuine English cowhide.

214
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:42,685
Combination lock.

215
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:46,105
- Fitted up with brushes, combs...
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.

216
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,191
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

217
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,818
I want a big one.

218
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,653
What did you stop it for?

219
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:55,990
I want you to take a good look
at that face.

220
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:57,116
Who is it?

221
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:58,284
George Bailey.

222
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,329
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears
slapped back by the druggist?

223
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,705
That's the kid.

224
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,793
It's a good face. I like it.

225
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,711
I like George Bailey.

226
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:11,798
Tell me,
did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

227
00:12:11,882 --> 00:12:13,049
Not a soul.

228
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:16,135
Did he ever marry the girl?
Did he ever go exploring?

229
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,970
Well, wait and see.

230
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,807
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

231
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,892
I want something for 1,001 nights

232
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:27,480
with plenty of room here for labels
from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

233
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,689
Great big thing, about...

234
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:30,942
- I see. A flying carpet, huh?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,444
I don't suppose you'd like
this old secondhand job, would you?

236
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,737
Now you're talking.

237
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,698
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft
in case the boat sunk.

238
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:40,034
- How much this cost?
- No charge.

239
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,829
That's my trick ear, Joe.
It sounded like you said "no charge."

240
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:43,913
That's right.

241
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:46,791
Well, what's my name doing on it?

242
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,919
A little present from old man Gower.
Came down and picked it out himself.

243
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,381
He did? What do you know about that?
My old boss. Isn't that nice?

244
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:54,715
What boat are you sailing on?

245
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,342
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

246
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,594
- A cattle boat?
- Okay, I like cows.

247
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,807
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

248
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,351
Thanks ever so much for the baggage.
It's just exactly what I wanted.

249
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,477
Forget it.

250
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:09,146
- It's wonderful of you to think of me.
- Hope you enjoy it.

251
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:11,023
I wish I had a million dollars.

252
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:12,358
Hot dog!

253
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:14,694
Avast there, Captain Cook!

254
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,029
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous francais, mister?

255
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:19,365
Hey, send us some of those
picture postcards, will you, George?

256
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,200
Hey, George,
don't take any plug nickels.

257
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,952
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

258
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,245
Hey, Ernie!

259
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,789
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert.
- Hiya, George.

260
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,666
- George.
- Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

261
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,209
How about driving me home in style?

262
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,961
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,964
And for the carriage trade,
I put on my hat.

264
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,759
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

265
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,052
Hello, Violet.

266
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,430
Hey, you look good.
That's some dress you got on there.

267
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,015
This old thing?

268
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,976
Why, I only wear it
when I don't care how I look.

269
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,535
- How would you like to take...
- Yes.

270
00:14:05,954 --> 00:14:07,622
Want to come along, Bert?
We'll show you the town.

271
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:08,789
No, thanks.

272
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:12,168
I think I'll go home
and see what the wife's doing.

273
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:15,338
Family man.

274
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,592
George, Harry,
you're shaking the house down.

275
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:20,760
Stop it.

276
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:23,471
Let them alone.
I wish I was up there with them.

277
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:26,515
But Harry will tear his dinner suit.
George!

278
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,517
That's why all children should be girls.

279
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,271
Well, if they were all girls
there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

280
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,941
George, Harry,
come down to dinner this minute.

281
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:38,027
Everything's getting cold, and you know
how long we've been waiting for you.

282
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,862
- Okay, Ma.
- Okay, Ma.

283
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:43,199
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

284
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,287
- We got a present for you, Pop.
- There you are.

285
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,166
Oh, you two idiots.

286
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,210
George, sit down and have dinner.

287
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,294
- Fine.
- I've eaten.

288
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,130
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing
for your graduating party? Look at you!

289
00:14:58,215 --> 00:14:59,632
I don't care. It's George's tux.

290
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:01,509
Annie, my sweet,
have you got those pies?

291
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,803
If you lay a hand on me,
I'll hit you with this broom!

292
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:07,098
Annie, I'm in love with you.
There's a moon out tonight.

293
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:11,143
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal
in the old Bailey boarding house.

294
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,145
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

295
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,606
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta
take over a lot of plates and things.

296
00:15:15,691 --> 00:15:16,649
What plates?

297
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,109
Mom, I'm chairman
of the Eats Committee.

298
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,360
We only need a couple of dozen.

299
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:22,822
Oh, no, you don't, Harry.
Now, not my best Haviland, no.

300
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:24,907
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

301
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,994
Hope you have a good trip, George.
Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

302
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:29,578
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

303
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:30,997
What's the matter? You look tired.

304
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,290
I had another tussle with Potter today.

305
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,376
I thought when we put him
on the board of directors,

306
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,794
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

307
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,755
What's eating that old
money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

308
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,758
He's a sick man, frustrated,
sick in his mind.

309
00:15:42,843 --> 00:15:44,677
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

310
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:47,513
He hates everybody
that has anything that he can't have.

311
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,265
He hates us mostly, I guess.

312
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,683
Gangway. Gangway.

313
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,226
- So long, Pop.
- So long.

314
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,311
- You got a match?
- Very funny, very funny.

315
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:55,354
Put those things in the car,

316
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,690
and I'll get your tie and studs ready
for you. Now, hurry up.

317
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:59,025
- Okay, Mom.
- Now, don't drop one of those.

318
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,317
You coming later, George?

319
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:01,694
What do you mean,
and be bored to death?

320
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,362
Couldn't want a better death.
Lots of pretty girls,

321
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:04,864
and we're gonna use
that new floor tonight, too.

322
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,615
- I hope it works.
- No gin tonight, Son.

323
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,908
Oh, Pop, just a little?

324
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:09,827
No, Son. Not one drop.

325
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,538
Boys and girls and music.

326
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,498
Why do they need gin?

327
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,626
Did I act like that
when I graduated from high school?

328
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:18,878
Pretty much.

329
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,048
You know, George, I wish
we could send Harry to college with you.

330
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:24,717
Your mother and I talked it over
half the night.

331
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,677
We have that all figured out.

332
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:28,888
You see, Harry will take my job
at the Building and Loan,

333
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:31,724
work there for four years, then he'll go.

334
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,476
Pretty young for that job.

335
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,269
Well, no younger than I was.

336
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,688
Well, you were born older, George.

337
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,232
How's that?

338
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:42,026
I said you were born older.

339
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,486
I suppose you've decided
what you want to do

340
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,862
when you get out of college.

341
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,906
Well, you know
what I've always talked about,

342
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,409
build things, design new buildings,
plan modern cities.

343
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,827
All that stuff I've been talking about.

344
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,704
Still after that first million
before you're 30?

345
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,248
I'll settle for half that in cash, though.

346
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,959
Of course, it's just a hope for then.

347
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,253
But you wouldn't consider coming back

348
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,547
to the Building and Loan, would you?

349
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:06,801
Well, I... I...

350
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:12,264
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
Then you'd be more comfortable,

351
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,183
and you could hear everything
that's going on.

352
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,727
I would if I thought
I'd hear anything worth listening to.

353
00:17:16,812 --> 00:17:18,354
You would, eh?

354
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,648
I know it's soon to talk about it.

355
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,317
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

356
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,320
I couldn't face being cooped up
for the rest of my life

357
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:28,197
in a shabby little office.

358
00:17:29,825 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

359
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:35,371
It's this business of nickels and dimes

360
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,623
and spending all your life
trying to figure out

361
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,625
how to save three cents
on a length of pipe.

362
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:42,795
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big
and something important.

363
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:45,798
You know, George,
I feel that, in a small way,

364
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,800
we're doing something important,

365
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,136
satisfying a fundamental urge.

366
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,473
It's deep in the race for a man to want
his own roof and walls and fireplace.

367
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:56,517
And we're helping him get those things

368
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,269
in our shabby little office.

369
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:02,022
I know, Pop. I know that.

370
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,150
I wish I felt that...

371
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:08,654
I've been hoarding pennies
like a miser here in order to...

372
00:18:09,072 --> 00:18:11,866
Most of my friends
have already finished college.

373
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:15,369
I just feel like if I didn't get away,
I'd bust.

374
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:20,082
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

375
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,876
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

376
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,502
This town is no place for any man

377
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:25,880
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

378
00:18:25,964 --> 00:18:28,507
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

379
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:32,469
You get yourself an education
and get out of here.

380
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:36,849
Pop, you want a shock?

381
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:40,477
I think you're a great guy.

382
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,317
- Why, did you hear that, Annie?
- I heard it.

383
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,320
It's about time
one of you lunkheads said it.

384
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:52,573
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

385
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:59,205
Pop, I think I'll get dressed
and go over to Harry's party.

386
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:00,915
Have a good time, Son.

387
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,129
Excuse me.

388
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:08,714
There you are.

389
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:09,882
George, hello.

390
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,175
You know my kid brother George.

391
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,219
- I'm gonna put him through college.
- Hello, George.

392
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:14,595
Hee-haw!

393
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,055
Sam Wainwright.

394
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,723
How are you? When did you get here?

395
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,892
This afternoon.
I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

396
00:19:19,976 --> 00:19:21,352
Old college graduate now.

397
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,520
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright
they call me.

398
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,398
Well, freshman, looks like
you're gonna make it after all, huh?

399
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,901
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see.
- Hello, Sam.

400
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:31,028
- Coach has heard all about you.
- He has?

401
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,947
Yeah, he's followed every game,
and his mouth's watering.

402
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,199
He wants me to find out
if you're gonna come along with us.

403
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,825
Well, I got to make some dough first.

404
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,453
Well, you better make it fast.
We need great ends like you.

405
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:41,205
Not broken down old guys like this one.

406
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,414
Hee-haw!

407
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,875
George, welcome back.

408
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,585
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

409
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,879
Putting a pool under this floor was
a great idea.

410
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:50,256
Saved us another building.

411
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,216
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

412
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,094
There's lots of stuff here to eat
and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

413
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,054
A third dance... A third...

414
00:19:57,138 --> 00:20:00,266
- Hello, Violet.
- Hello. What am I bid?

415
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,517
George.

416
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,435
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

417
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,604
- Marty!
- Sam, Harry, how are you?

418
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:07,564
- Do me a favor, will you, George?
- What's that?

419
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:10,067
- You remember my kid sister Mary.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

420
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:12,444
"Mama wants you, Marty.
Mama wants you." Remember?

421
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,862
Dance with her, will you?

422
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:17,074
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough
already with all these kids.

423
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:18,200
Come on, be a sport.

424
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,620
Just dance with her one time, and you'll
give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

425
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,205
Don't be long, Marty.

426
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,999
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

427
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,084
The next thing I knew,
some guy came up and tripped me.

428
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:29,086
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

429
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,880
If it hadn't been for that,
that race'd have been a cinch.

430
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,925
I tried to find out who it was later,
but I couldn't find out.

431
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,679
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was,
because they'd be scared.

432
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:40,222
'Cause they know
what kind of a guy I am.

433
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:42,433
You remember George. This is Mary.

434
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,143
Well, I'll be seeing you.

435
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:45,311
Well, well, well.

436
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,105
Now to get back to my story, see?

437
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,568
Hey, this is my dance.

438
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,236
Why don't you stop annoying people?

439
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,447
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

440
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:02,286
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

441
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:04,955
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

442
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,248
Well, I don't.

443
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,667
You've passed me on the street
almost every day.

444
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:09,835
Me?

445
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,088
No. That was a little girl
named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

446
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,925
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
The big Charleston contest!

447
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:21,972
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

448
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:24,850
Those not tapped by the judges
will remain on the floor.

449
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,060
Let's go!

450
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:37,821
I'm not very good at this.

451
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:39,490
Neither am I.

452
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:41,450
Okay. What can we lose?

453
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,797
Hey, you're wonderful.

454
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:24,535
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

455
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:29,415
Did you know there's a swimming pool
under this floor?

456
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:33,669
And did you know that button behind you
causes this floor to open up?

457
00:22:34,796 --> 00:22:38,090
And did you further know
that George Bailey

458
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,509
is dancing right over that crack?

459
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,679
And I've got the key.

460
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,954
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

461
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,836
They're cheering us. We must be good.

462
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,209
Get out of there!

463
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,835
What... Oh, well.

464
00:24:04,552 --> 00:24:06,595
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

465
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,473
Can't you come out tonight?

466
00:24:09,557 --> 00:24:12,059
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

467
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:15,938
And dance

468
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:19,024
By the light

469
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:23,654
Of the moon?

470
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:27,032
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ.
- Beautiful.

471
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,284
I told Harry I thought
I'd be bored to death.

472
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,620
You should have seen
the commotion in that locker room.

473
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,456
I had to knock down three people
to get this stuff we're wearing here.

474
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,416
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

475
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,168
Do I look as funny as you do?

476
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:40,087
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

477
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:41,922
You look wonderful!

478
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,674
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

479
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,343
I'd say you were
the prettiest girl in town.

480
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:49,388
Well, why don't you say it?

481
00:24:49,472 --> 00:24:52,808
I don't know. Maybe I will say it.
How old are you anyway?

482
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:54,935
Eighteen.

483
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:58,522
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year
you were seventeen.

484
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:00,566
Too young or too old?

485
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,360
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

486
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:06,905
Yes, sir, you look a little older
without your clothes on.

487
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,367
I mean, without a dress you look older.

488
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:13,370
I mean younger. You look... You just...

489
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:16,415
I'm on the thing here.

490
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:18,417
Sir, my train, please.

491
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,211
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

492
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:24,548
Your caboose, milady.

493
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,551
You may kiss my hand.

494
00:25:30,013 --> 00:25:31,471
Hey.

495
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:34,850
Hey, Mary.

496
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,937
As I was lumberin' down the street

497
00:25:39,022 --> 00:25:41,440
Down the street, down the street

498
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:44,109
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock
at the old Granville house.

499
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:46,361
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

500
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:48,363
No, you see, you make a wish
and then try and break some glass.

501
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:50,073
And you got to be
a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

502
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:53,035
Oh, no, George, don't.
It's full of romance, that old place.

503
00:25:53,411 --> 00:25:55,329
I'd like to live in it.

504
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,538
In that place?

505
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,957
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost.
Now, watch.

506
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:01,668
Right in the second floor, there. See?

507
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:07,549
What did you wish, George?

508
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:10,052
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

509
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:12,220
Mary, I know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow

510
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,931
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

511
00:26:15,016 --> 00:26:17,851
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

512
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,686
and I'm gonna see the world!

513
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:22,856
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon,
the Coliseum.

514
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,609
Then I'm coming back here and go
to college to see what they know.

515
00:26:25,693 --> 00:26:27,319
And then I'm gonna build things.

516
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:28,820
I'm gonna build airfields.

517
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:31,281
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

518
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:33,742
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

519
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:36,244
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

520
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,042
Hey, that's pretty good.

521
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:44,711
What did you wish, Mary?

522
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:49,675
Buffalo gals
can't you come out tonight?

523
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,678
Can't you come out tonight?

524
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:55,764
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

525
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:58,850
And

526
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:02,979
Dance by the light of the moon?

527
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,023
What did you wish
when you threw that rock?

528
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,525
- Oh, no.
- Come on, tell me.

529
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:08,193
If I told you, it might not come true.

530
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:10,028
What is it you want, Mary?

531
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,906
What do you want? You want the moon?

532
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:16,535
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down.

533
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:20,414
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

534
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:21,998
I'll take it.

535
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,500
Then what?

536
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,462
Well, then you could swallow it,
and it would all dissolve, see?

537
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:31,341
And the moonbeams would shoot out
of your fingers and your toes

538
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,468
and the ends of your hair.

539
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:37,514
- Am I talking too much?
- Yes!

540
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,809
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

541
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:41,935
How's that?

542
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:45,480
Why don't you kiss her
instead of talking her to death?

543
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,734
You want me to kiss her, huh?

544
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:52,195
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

545
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:56,616
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister.
Come on back out here!

546
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:00,954
I'll show you some kissing that'll put
hair back on your head. What are you...

547
00:28:08,296 --> 00:28:09,379
Mary?

548
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:22,517
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

549
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,729
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

550
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,315
Here you are. Catch.

551
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,818
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

552
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:38,533
This is a very interesting situation.

553
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:40,452
Please give me my robe.

554
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,040
A man doesn't get in a situation
like this every day.

555
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:47,125
I'd like to have my robe.

556
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,752
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

557
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:51,046
- Ouch! Oh!
- Gesundheit.

558
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:53,799
- George Bailey!
- This requires a little thought here.

559
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:55,550
Give me my robe.

560
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:58,053
I've read about things like this,
but I've never...

561
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:01,306
Shame on you!
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

562
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,975
My mother's way up on the corner there.

563
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,019
I'll call the police.

564
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,897
They're way downtown.
They'd be on my side, too.

565
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,857
Then I'm going to scream!

566
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,360
Maybe I could sell tickets.

567
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:17,572
Let's see. No, the point is

568
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,367
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

569
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,327
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

570
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:24,746
George! George!

571
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,501
George, come on home! Quick!

572
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:32,003
- Your father's had a stroke.
- What?

573
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:35,257
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
- Come on, George, let's hurry.

574
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,424
- Did you get a doctor?
- Yes.

575
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:38,343
Campbell's there now.

576
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,564
I think that's all
we'll need you for, George.

577
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:53,525
- I know you're anxious to make a train.
- I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

578
00:29:53,609 --> 00:29:56,403
I want the board to know
that George gave up his trip to Europe

579
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,239
to help straighten things out here
these past few months.

580
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:01,199
Good luck to you at school, George.

581
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,243
- Good luck, George.
- Goodbye, George.

582
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,954
And now we come to the real purpose
of this meeting,

583
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,707
to appoint a successor
to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

584
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,959
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to get to my real purpose.

585
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,253
- Wait just a minute now.
- Wait for what?

586
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:16,715
I claim this institution
is not necessary to this town.

587
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,635
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make
a motion to dissolve this institution

588
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,014
and turn its assets and liabilities
over to the receiver.

589
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,057
Potter, you dirty, contemptible...
I'll wring his neck.

590
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:27,142
George, did you hear
what that buzzard...

591
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,268
Mr. Chairman.

592
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,145
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

593
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,564
to talk about chloroforming
the Building and Loan.

594
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:35,066
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

595
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:36,943
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

596
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:38,445
Very well. In that case,

597
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:42,407
I'll ask the two executive officers
to withdraw. But before you go,

598
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:45,619
I'm sure the whole board wishes
to express its deep sorrow

599
00:30:45,703 --> 00:30:47,913
- at the passing of Peter Bailey.
- Thank you very much.

600
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:49,915
It was his faith and devotion

601
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,583
that are responsible
for this organization.

602
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,585
I'll go further than that.

603
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:58,089
I'll say that to the public
Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

604
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:00,383
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

605
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:02,427
considering that you probably
drove him to his grave.

606
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:05,347
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

607
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,890
That's what killed him.

608
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,684
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him.
God rest his soul.

609
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:13,229
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

610
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:17,567
But ideals without common sense
can ruin this town.

611
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:21,154
Now, you take this loan here
to Ernie Bishop,

612
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:24,574
you know,
that fellow that sits around all day

613
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,452
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

614
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:31,331
I happen to know
the bank turned down this loan.

615
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:33,124
But he comes here,

616
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:37,963
and we're building him
a house worth $5,000.

617
00:31:38,714 --> 00:31:41,132
- Why?
- Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

618
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:44,094
You have all the papers there.
His salary, insurance.

619
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:45,512
I can personally vouch for his character.

620
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:47,514
- A friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

621
00:31:48,057 --> 00:31:51,851
You see, if you shoot pool
with some employee here,

622
00:31:51,936 --> 00:31:54,187
you can come and borrow money.

623
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:56,356
What does that get us?

624
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,317
A discontented, lazy rabble

625
00:31:59,402 --> 00:32:01,319
instead of a thrifty working class.

626
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:05,198
And all because
a few starry-eyed dreamers

627
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:08,493
like Peter Bailey stir them up
and fill their heads

628
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:10,829
with a lot of impossible ideas.

629
00:32:10,913 --> 00:32:12,706
Now, I say...

630
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,667
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

631
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:19,004
You're right when you say my father
was no businessman. I know that.

632
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,715
Why he ever started this cheap
penny-ante Building and Loan

633
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:22,882
I'll never know.

634
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,844
But neither you nor anybody else
can say anything against his character,

635
00:32:25,928 --> 00:32:27,637
because his whole life was...

636
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:30,348
Why, in the 25 years since he
and Uncle Billy started this thing,

637
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,726
he never once thought of himself.
Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

638
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,687
He didn't save enough money
to send Harry to school, let alone me.

639
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,523
But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

640
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:42,694
And what's wrong with that?
Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

641
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:46,031
Don't it make them better citizens, and
doesn't it make them better customers?

642
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:48,324
You said that they...
What'd you say just a minute ago?

643
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,201
They had to wait and save their money

644
00:32:50,286 --> 00:32:51,745
before they even thought
of a decent home.

645
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:53,538
Wait? Wait for what?

646
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:55,290
Until their children grow up
and leave them?

647
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,542
Until they're so old
and broken-down that they...

648
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:00,253
Do you know how long it takes
a working man to save $5,000?

649
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:03,715
Just remember this, Mr. Potter,
that this rabble you're talking about,

650
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,719
they do most of the working and paying
and living and dying in this community.

651
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:10,263
Well, is it too much to have them work
and pay and live and die

652
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,140
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

653
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,309
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

654
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:17,270
People were human beings to him,
but to you,

655
00:33:17,354 --> 00:33:20,315
a warped, frustrated old man,
they're cattle.

656
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:22,901
Well, in my book, he died
a much richer man than you'll ever be.

657
00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:24,903
I'm not interested in your book.

658
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:27,739
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

659
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,532
I know very well
what you're talking about.

660
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:31,910
You're talking about something
you can't get your fingers on,

661
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:34,829
and it's galling you.
That's what you're talking about, I know.

662
00:33:34,914 --> 00:33:37,207
Well, I've said too much. I...

663
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,585
You're the Board here.
You do what you want with this thing.

664
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,253
There's just one thing more, though.

665
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:44,964
This town needs
this measly one-horse institution

666
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:48,635
if only to have someplace where people
can come without crawling to Potter.

667
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,844
Come on, Uncle Billy.

668
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:59,229
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

669
00:34:01,357 --> 00:34:03,942
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him,
George, old boy.

670
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:05,819
You shut his big mouth.
You should have heard him.

671
00:34:05,903 --> 00:34:07,612
What happened?
We heard a lot of yelling.

672
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,323
Well, we're being voted
out of business after 25 years.

673
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:13,910
- Easy come, easy go.
- Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

674
00:34:13,994 --> 00:34:15,954
You still want me
to hang around, George?

675
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:18,581
- Yeah, I'll be right down.
- Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

676
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,458
You're a week late for school already.
Go on.

677
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:23,336
- What's going on in there?
- Never mind. Don't worry about that.

678
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,464
They're putting us out of business.
So what? I can get another job.

679
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:28,299
- I'm only 55.
- 56.

680
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,718
Go on, go on.
Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

681
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:32,387
now you don't want to miss college,
too, do you?

682
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,931
George! George!
They voted Potter down.

683
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,808
They want to keep it going.

684
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,352
You did it, George. You did it.

685
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:41,646
They got one condition,
only one condition.

686
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,314
- What's that?
- And that's the best part of it.

687
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,400
They've appointed George here
as Executive Secretary

688
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,776
to take his father's place.

689
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:49,696
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy...
- You can keep him on. That's all right.

690
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,698
As Secretary,
you can hire anyone you like.

691
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:54,409
Dr. Campbell, now let's get
this thing straight. I'm leaving.

692
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,119
I'm leaving right now.
I'm going to school.

693
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:58,663
This is my last chance.
Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

694
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:01,583
But, George,
they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

695
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:06,421
- I know, I know, he didn't go.
- That's right.

696
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,841
Not only that, but he gave
his school money to his brother, Harry,

697
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,426
and sent him to college.

698
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,386
Harry became a football star.

699
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,762
Made second team all-American.

700
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:17,473
Yeah, but what happened to George?

701
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:20,768
George got four years older,
waiting for Harry to come back

702
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:22,937
and take over the Building and Loans.

703
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:25,356
There are plenty of jobs around
for somebody that likes to travel.

704
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:26,441
Look at this. Here.

705
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:30,862
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted,
man with construction experience."

706
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:32,947
Here's the Yukon, right here.

707
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:35,408
"Wanted,
man with engineering experience."

708
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,369
There she blows.

709
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:41,331
You know what the three most exciting
sounds in the world are?

710
00:35:41,415 --> 00:35:43,666
Breakfast is served.
Lunch is served. Dinner...

711
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:47,462
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains,
plane motors and train whistles.

712
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:49,714
- Peanut?
- There's the professor now.

713
00:35:49,798 --> 00:35:52,091
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa
all-American Bailey.

714
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:54,219
Why, old George
"Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

715
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,888
What? No husky dogs? No sled?
Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

716
00:35:56,972 --> 00:35:58,514
Nobody ever changes here,
you know that.

717
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,266
Oh, am I glad to see you.

718
00:36:00,351 --> 00:36:02,560
- Say, where's Mother?
- She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

719
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:04,479
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

720
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,523
George, Uncle Billy,
I want you to meet Ruth.

721
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:08,942
- Hello.
- How do you do?

722
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:11,778
- Ruth Dakin.
- Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

723
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:14,239
- Huh?
- Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

724
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:15,949
Here she is. Meet the wife.

725
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,868
Well, what do you know? A wife.

726
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:22,747
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations.
- How do you do?

727
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:25,541
What am I doing? Congratulations!

728
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,377
- Doggone it, Harry, you...
- They're married!

729
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,587
Why don't you tell somebody?

730
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:32,257
Come on, Mrs. Bailey,
I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

731
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:33,758
- You're really married?
- Why, yes.

732
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,551
What's a pretty girl like you doing

733
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,595
marrying this two-headed brother
of mine?

734
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,390
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary.
My father offered him a job.

735
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:44,602
Oh, he got you and the job?
Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

736
00:36:45,354 --> 00:36:49,274
George, about that job. Ruth spoke
out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

737
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:52,193
You've been holding the bag here
for four years, and,

738
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:55,071
well, I won't let you down, George.
I would like to...

739
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,283
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags.
I'll be right back.

740
00:36:58,367 --> 00:36:59,575
It was a surprise to me.

741
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,619
This is the new Mrs. Bailey,
my nephew's wife.

742
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:05,498
- How are you?
- Old, old friend of the Baileys.

743
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:08,710
Oh, really? What are their names?
Let's see...

744
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,713
Oh, of course,
I've heard him speak of you.

745
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:14,173
And I want to tell you,
we're gonna give the biggest party

746
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,717
this town ever saw.

747
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:20,221
Here, have some popcorn.

748
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,892
George, George, George.
That's all Harry ever talks about.

749
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,228
Ruth, this...

750
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:28,479
What about this job?

751
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,982
Well, my father owns a glass factory
in Buffalo.

752
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:33,818
He wants to get Harry started
in the research business.

753
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:36,070
- Well, is it a good job?
- Oh, yes, very.

754
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:38,823
Not much money,
but good future, you know.

755
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,242
- Yeah.
- Harry's a genius at research.

756
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,746
- My father just fell in love with him.
- And you did, too.

757
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:00,386
Hey, Joe.

758
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:04,057
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
I feel so good.

759
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:08,811
I could spit in Potter's eye.
I think I will. I think I will.

760
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:11,397
What did you say? Huh?

761
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:14,192
Maybe I'd better go home.

762
00:38:14,276 --> 00:38:16,611
Where's my hat? Where's my...

763
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:20,531
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine?
- The middle one.

764
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:23,701
Oh, thank you, George.
Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

765
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:27,121
if you'll point me in the right direction...
Would you do that, George?

766
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:28,373
Right down here.

767
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:31,167
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

768
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:33,544
Now you just turn this way
and then right straight down there.

769
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:34,712
Oh, that way, huh?

770
00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:40,093
My wild Irish rose

771
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:45,723
I'm all right. I'm all right.

772
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:50,645
The sweetest flower I know

773
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:29,308
Hello, Ma.

774
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:33,104
That's for nothing.

775
00:39:34,523 --> 00:39:37,066
- How do you like her?
- She's swell, isn't she?

776
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:39,944
Looks like
she can keep Harry on his toes.

777
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:42,363
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

778
00:39:44,491 --> 00:39:47,285
Did you know that Mary Hatch
is back from school?

779
00:39:47,995 --> 00:39:50,037
Came back three days ago.

780
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:53,207
Nice girl, Mary.

781
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:57,879
Kind that'll help you
find the answers, George.

782
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:00,423
Stop that grunting.

783
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:05,887
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't call on Mary?

784
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,388
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

785
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:09,432
- Hee-haw?
- Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

786
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:11,809
- Well, she's not crazy about him.
- Well, how do you know?

787
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:13,644
- What, did she discuss it with you?
- No.

788
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:16,481
- Well, then how do you know?
- Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

789
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:19,901
Why, she lights up like a firefly
whenever you're around.

790
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:23,488
Besides,
Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

791
00:40:23,572 --> 00:40:27,575
- and you're here in Bedford Falls.
- And all's fair in love and war.

792
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,911
I don't know about war.

793
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:37,001
Mother of mine, I can see right through
you right to your back-collar button.

794
00:40:37,085 --> 00:40:39,086
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

795
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,175
Well, here's your hat.
What's your hurry?

796
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:48,137
All right, Mother,
old Building and Loan pal,

797
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:51,474
I think I'll go out and find a girl
and do a little passionate necking.

798
00:40:51,558 --> 00:40:52,767
Oh, George.

799
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,895
Now, if you'll just point me
in the right direction...

800
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:58,564
This direction.

801
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:07,448
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

802
00:41:18,794 --> 00:41:21,504
- Excuse me.
- Now, wait a minute.

803
00:41:21,588 --> 00:41:23,714
I think I got a date.

804
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,551
But stick around, fellows,
just in case, huh?

805
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:29,637
We'll wait for you, baby.

806
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:33,808
- Hello, Georgie Porgie!
- Hello Vi.

807
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:37,061
- What gives?
- Nothing.

808
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:39,397
Where are you going?

809
00:41:39,481 --> 00:41:42,316
Oh, I'll probably end up
down at the library.

810
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:46,779
Georgie, don't you ever get tired
of just reading about things?

811
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:48,906
Yes.

812
00:41:49,783 --> 00:41:52,243
- What are you doing tonight?
- Not a thing.

813
00:41:52,828 --> 00:41:54,620
Are you game, Vi?
Let's make a night of it.

814
00:41:54,705 --> 00:41:56,914
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

815
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,916
Let's go out in the fields
and take off our shoes

816
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:01,419
- and walk through the grass.
- Huh?

817
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:04,422
Then we can go up to the falls.
It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

818
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:08,676
and there's a green pool up there,
and we can swim in it.

819
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:12,513
Then we can climb Mount Bedford
and smell the pines

820
00:42:12,598 --> 00:42:14,265
and watch the sunrise
against the peaks,

821
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:15,766
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

822
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:18,102
and everybody'll be talking.
There'll be a terrific scandal.

823
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:21,981
Georgie, have you gone crazy?
Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

824
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:25,067
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

825
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:29,530
- If you think...
- Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

826
00:42:47,174 --> 00:42:50,593
- What are you doing, picketing?
- Hello, Mary.

827
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:53,763
I just happened to be passing by here.

828
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:55,681
Yes, so I noticed.

829
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,601
- Have you made up your mind?
- How's that?

830
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:01,312
- Have you made up your mind?
- About what?

831
00:43:01,396 --> 00:43:02,772
About coming in.

832
00:43:03,398 --> 00:43:05,441
Your mother just phoned
and said you were on your way over

833
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:08,319
- to pay me a visit.
- My mother just called you?

834
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:09,779
Well, how did she know?

835
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,822
- Didn't you tell her?
- I didn't tell anybody.

836
00:43:11,907 --> 00:43:14,742
I just went for a walk
and happened to be passing by here.

837
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:16,369
What do you...

838
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:20,039
Went for a walk. That's all.

839
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:24,293
- I'll be downstairs, Mother.
- All right, dear.

840
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:48,442
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

841
00:43:48,777 --> 00:43:51,028
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

842
00:43:53,073 --> 00:43:54,448
But I...

843
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:09,630
I didn't tell anybody
I was coming over here, you know.

844
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,926
- When did you get back?
- Tuesday.

845
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:16,971
Where did you get that dress?

846
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:19,640
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

847
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:25,896
I thought you would go back
to New York,

848
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:28,315
like Sam and Angie
and the rest of them.

849
00:44:29,776 --> 00:44:33,320
I worked there a couple of vacations,
but I don't know.

850
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:34,780
I guess I was homesick.

851
00:44:34,865 --> 00:44:37,867
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

852
00:44:38,118 --> 00:44:41,162
Yes, and my family and...

853
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,539
Everything.

854
00:44:44,875 --> 00:44:46,584
Would you like to sit down?

855
00:44:46,668 --> 00:44:48,502
All right, for a minute.

856
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:51,255
I still can't understand it, though.

857
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:53,466
You know, I didn't tell anybody
I was coming here.

858
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,925
Would you rather leave?

859
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,844
No. I don't want to be rude.

860
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,471
Well, then, sit down.

861
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,847
What's that?

862
00:45:02,893 --> 00:45:04,435
Some joke, huh?

863
00:45:09,524 --> 00:45:10,733
Well...

864
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:14,987
I see it still smells like pine needles
around here.

865
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:16,864
Thank you.

866
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,873
And dance by the

867
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,708
What's the matter?

868
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:30,628
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

869
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:34,632
Well...

870
00:45:34,716 --> 00:45:37,092
Nice about your brother Harry
and Ruth, isn't it?

871
00:45:37,177 --> 00:45:39,261
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

872
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:40,679
Don't you like her?

873
00:45:40,764 --> 00:45:43,224
Well, of course I like her.
She's a peach.

874
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:48,312
Oh, just marriage in general
you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

875
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:52,942
No. Marriage is all right
for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

876
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:54,735
Mary! Mary!

877
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,195
Who's down there with you?

878
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:58,155
It's George Bailey, Mother.

879
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:00,950
George Bailey? What's he want?

880
00:46:01,243 --> 00:46:02,576
I don't know.

881
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,370
What do you want?

882
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,873
Me? Not a thing.

883
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:10,000
I just came in to get warm.

884
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:15,130
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

885
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:18,926
You tell him to go right back home,
and don't you leave the house, either!

886
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,137
Sam Wainwright promised to call you
from New York tonight.

887
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:25,224
What's your mother mean?
You know, I didn't come here to...

888
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:27,852
- What did you come here for, then?
- I don't know. You tell me.

889
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:30,521
You're supposed to be the one
that has all the answers. You tell me.

890
00:46:30,605 --> 00:46:32,481
- Why don't you go home?
- That's where I'm going.

891
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:34,191
I don't know why I came here
in the first place.

892
00:46:34,276 --> 00:46:35,734
- Good night.
- Good night!

893
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:38,863
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

894
00:46:38,947 --> 00:46:40,155
I'll get it.

895
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:43,033
Whatever were you doing
that you couldn't hear?

896
00:46:52,127 --> 00:46:54,378
Mary, he's waiting.

897
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:58,924
Hello?

898
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:02,219
Forgot my hat.

899
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:07,433
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

900
00:47:07,517 --> 00:47:10,561
I'm great.
Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

901
00:47:10,645 --> 00:47:13,480
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

902
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,693
There's an old friend of yours here.
George Bailey.

903
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:19,695
You mean old mossback George?

904
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:22,406
Yes, old mossback George.

905
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,408
Hee-haw! Put him on.

906
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:26,785
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

907
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,079
He doesn't want to speak to George,
you idiot.

908
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:30,998
He does so. He asked for him.

909
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,543
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

910
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:39,965
Hi, Sam.

911
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,886
Well, George Baileyoffski!
Hey, a fine pal you are.

912
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:45,804
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

913
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:46,889
What do you mean?

914
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:48,766
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

915
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,768
Here... Here's Mary.

916
00:47:50,852 --> 00:47:53,228
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I want to talk to both of you.

917
00:47:53,313 --> 00:47:54,772
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

918
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:58,192
- Mother's on the extension. We...
- I am not!

919
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:00,319
We can both hear. Come here.

920
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:03,113
We're listening, Sam.

921
00:48:03,198 --> 00:48:06,742
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up
that's gonna make us all rich.

922
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:09,411
George, do you remember
that night in Martini's bar

923
00:48:09,496 --> 00:48:13,165
when you told me you'd read someplace
about making plastics out of soybeans?

924
00:48:13,249 --> 00:48:15,417
- Chili beans.
- Shut up, will you?

925
00:48:15,502 --> 00:48:18,212
You remember, out of chili...
Out of soybeans.

926
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:22,466
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

927
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,885
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

928
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,471
and he's gonna build
a factory outside of Rochester.

929
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,098
How do you like that?

930
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,019
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

931
00:48:34,104 --> 00:48:36,855
Well, why not?
Can you think of anything better?

932
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,567
Well, I don't know.
Just why not right here?

933
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:44,363
You remember that old tool
and machinery works?

934
00:48:44,447 --> 00:48:46,490
You tell your father
he can get that for a song.

935
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:47,825
And all the labor he wants, too.

936
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,369
Half the town was thrown out of work
when they closed down.

937
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:52,746
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

938
00:48:52,831 --> 00:48:54,164
Hey, that sounds great.

939
00:48:54,249 --> 00:48:56,125
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

940
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:59,253
Now here's the point, Mary.
Mary, you're in on this, too.

941
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:01,755
Now listen. Have you got any money?

942
00:49:04,467 --> 00:49:06,468
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

943
00:49:06,553 --> 00:49:07,511
Well, now, listen.

944
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:10,806
I want you to put every cent you've got
into our stock, do you hear?

945
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:13,600
And, George, I may have a job for you,

946
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:17,646
that is unless you're still married
to that broken-down Building and Loan.

947
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:19,940
Well, this is the biggest thing
since radio,

948
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:22,151
and I'm letting you in
on the ground floor.

949
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:24,278
Oh, Mary. Mary?

950
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,198
I'm here.

951
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,534
Would you tell that guy

952
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:32,703
I'm giving him the chance
of a lifetime, do you hear?

953
00:49:32,787 --> 00:49:34,621
The chance of a lifetime!

954
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:40,544
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

955
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:45,591
Now you listen to me.

956
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,802
I don't want any plastics,
and I don't want any ground floors.

957
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:50,846
And I don't want to get married,
ever, to anyone.

958
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:52,347
You understand that?

959
00:49:52,432 --> 00:49:54,391
I want to do what I want to do.

960
00:49:54,476 --> 00:49:57,519
And you're... And you're...

961
00:49:57,604 --> 00:50:01,106
- Oh, Mary, Mary.
- George, George, George.

962
00:50:03,818 --> 00:50:05,110
Oh, Mary.

963
00:50:06,654 --> 00:50:10,240
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

964
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:13,077
Mary...

965
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:15,579
Here they come! Here they come!

966
00:50:40,939 --> 00:50:42,689
Goodbye, George!

967
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,361
Goodbye!

968
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:57,287
First Harry, now George.

969
00:50:57,372 --> 00:50:59,581
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

970
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:01,792
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

971
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,840
If either of you two
see a stranger around here, it's me.

972
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:12,469
Hey, look.
There's somebody driving this cab.

973
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,388
Bert the cop sent this over.

974
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,849
He said to float away
to Happyland on the bubbles.

975
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:19,143
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

976
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:22,396
By the way, where are you two going
on this here now honeymoon?

977
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,606
Where are we going? Look at this.

978
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:27,067
There's the kitty, Ernie.
Here, come on, count it, Mary.

979
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:29,236
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

980
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,697
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna shoot the works.

981
00:51:31,781 --> 00:51:34,032
A whole week in New York.
A whole week in Bermuda.

982
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:36,577
The highest hotels,
the oldest champagne,

983
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:41,165
the richest caviar, the hottest music
and the prettiest wife.

984
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:43,500
That does it! Then what?

985
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:46,587
- Then what, honey?
- After that, who cares?

986
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,047
That does it, come here. Come here.

987
00:51:52,218 --> 00:51:53,760
Don't look now,
but there's something funny

988
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:56,054
going on over there
at the bank, George.

989
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:00,184
I've never really seen one, but that's got
all the earmarks of being a run.

990
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:10,694
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money
in the bank, you better hurry.

991
00:52:10,778 --> 00:52:12,529
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

992
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:14,114
Just a minute, dear.

993
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:20,704
- Please, let's not stop, George.
- I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

994
00:52:37,263 --> 00:52:39,765
Well, hello, everybody.
Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

995
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:42,684
Charlie? What's the matter here,
can't you get in?

996
00:52:59,994 --> 00:53:02,287
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

997
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:03,705
George.

998
00:53:04,415 --> 00:53:08,418
Come on in, everybody.
That's right. Just come on in.

999
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,920
Look out, you.

1000
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:13,757
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1001
00:53:13,841 --> 00:53:16,009
There are a lot of seats over there.

1002
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:18,887
Just make yourselves at home.

1003
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,891
George, can I see you a minute?

1004
00:53:23,476 --> 00:53:25,727
- Why didn't you call me?
- I just did, but they said you left.

1005
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:27,396
This is a pickle, George.
This is a pickle.

1006
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,022
All right, now, what happened?
How did it start?

1007
00:53:29,107 --> 00:53:30,232
How does a thing like this ever start?

1008
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:31,984
- All I know is the bank called our loan.
- When?

1009
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:34,278
About an hour ago.
I handed over all our cash.

1010
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:35,696
- All of it?
- Every cent of it,

1011
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,156
- and still it was less than we owe them.
- Holy mackerel!

1012
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:40,367
And then I got scared, George,
and closed the doors.

1013
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,119
I... I...

1014
00:53:44,163 --> 00:53:45,914
The whole town's gone crazy.

1015
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:47,332
Yeah, hello?

1016
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,543
George, it's Potter.

1017
00:53:53,089 --> 00:53:54,172
Hello?

1018
00:53:54,257 --> 00:53:58,635
George, there is a rumor around town
that you've closed your doors.

1019
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,178
Is that true?

1020
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:02,806
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1021
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:06,226
George, are you all right?
Do you need any police?

1022
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:07,686
Police? What for?

1023
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:11,732
Well, mobs get pretty ugly
sometimes, you know.

1024
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:16,528
George, I'm going all out
to help in this crisis.

1025
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:21,783
I've just guaranteed the bank
sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1026
00:54:22,118 --> 00:54:25,495
They'll close up for a week
and then reopen.

1027
00:54:26,372 --> 00:54:28,165
He just took over the bank.

1028
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:30,042
I may lose a fortune,

1029
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:34,004
but I'm willing
to guarantee your people, too.

1030
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,548
Just tell them
to bring their shares over here,

1031
00:54:36,632 --> 00:54:39,217
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1032
00:54:39,302 --> 00:54:41,428
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1033
00:54:41,512 --> 00:54:42,679
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1034
00:54:42,764 --> 00:54:46,475
If you close your doors before 6:00 p. M.,
you will never reopen.

1035
00:54:55,276 --> 00:54:56,735
George, was it a nice wedding?

1036
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,820
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1037
00:54:59,238 --> 00:55:00,280
Yeah.

1038
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,117
You can take this one off now.

1039
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,298
Now, just remember that this thing
isn't as black as it appeared.

1040
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,893
I have some news for you, folks.

1041
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:31,395
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1042
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:33,105
and he's guaranteed cash payments
at the bank.

1043
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:34,731
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1044
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:36,733
But, George, I got my money here.

1045
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:38,402
Did he guarantee this place?

1046
00:55:38,486 --> 00:55:41,530
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.
We don't need Potter over here.

1047
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:43,323
Then, I'll take mine now.

1048
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:45,325
No, but you're...

1049
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,245
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1050
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:51,915
as if I had the money back in a safe.
The money's not here.

1051
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,543
Well, your money's in Joe's house.
That's right next to yours.

1052
00:55:54,627 --> 00:55:56,878
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs. Macklin's house

1053
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:58,463
and 100 others.

1054
00:55:58,548 --> 00:56:00,132
Why, you're lending them
the money to build,

1055
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:02,259
and then, they're gonna pay it back
to you as best they can.

1056
00:56:02,343 --> 00:56:04,010
Now, what are you gonna do,
foreclose on them?

1057
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:10,142
I got $242 in here,
and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1058
00:56:11,018 --> 00:56:13,603
Okay, Tom. All right.

1059
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:16,440
Here you are. You sign this.
You'll get your money in 60 days.

1060
00:56:16,524 --> 00:56:17,649
Sixty days?

1061
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,776
Now, that's what you agreed to
when you bought your shares.

1062
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:21,987
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money?
- No.

1063
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:23,113
Well, I did.

1064
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:25,824
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents
on the dollar for every share you've got.

1065
00:56:25,908 --> 00:56:28,493
- Fifty cents on the dollar!
- Yes, cash!

1066
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:30,162
Well, what do you say?

1067
00:56:30,246 --> 00:56:32,873
Now, Tom, you have to stick
to your original agreement.

1068
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:34,291
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1069
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,460
- Okay, Randall.
- Are you going to go to Potter's?

1070
00:56:36,544 --> 00:56:38,628
Better to get half than nothing.

1071
00:56:38,713 --> 00:56:40,797
Tom! Tom!

1072
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,049
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1073
00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:47,220
Now, listen. Now, listen to me.
I beg of you not to do this thing.

1074
00:56:47,305 --> 00:56:49,389
If Potter gets a hold
of this Building and Loan,

1075
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:51,433
there'll never be
another decent house built in this town.

1076
00:56:51,517 --> 00:56:53,018
He's already got charge of the bank.

1077
00:56:53,102 --> 00:56:55,145
He's got the bus line.
He got the department stores.

1078
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:57,981
And now he's after us. Why?
Well, it's very simple.

1079
00:56:58,065 --> 00:57:00,317
Because we're cutting in
on his business, that's why.

1080
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:02,486
And because he wants
to keep you living in his slums

1081
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:04,488
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1082
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:06,490
Joe, you had one
of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1083
00:57:06,574 --> 00:57:07,574
Well, have you forgotten?

1084
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:10,035
Have you forgotten what he charged you
for that broken-down shack?

1085
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:13,246
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last
year when things weren't going so well

1086
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,498
and you couldn't make your payments.

1087
00:57:14,582 --> 00:57:16,041
Well, you didn't lose your house,
did you?

1088
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,876
You think Potter would've
let you keep it?

1089
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,670
Can't you understand
what's happening here?

1090
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:22,339
Don't you see what's happening?

1091
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:25,133
Potter isn't selling.
Potter's buying, and why?

1092
00:57:25,218 --> 00:57:27,385
Because we're panicky and he's not.
That's why.

1093
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:28,678
He's picking up some bargain.

1094
00:57:28,763 --> 00:57:31,139
Now we can get through
this thing all right.

1095
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,016
We've got to stick together, though.

1096
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,601
We've got to have faith in each other.

1097
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:37,896
But my husband hasn't worked
in over a year, and I need money.

1098
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:39,689
How am going to live
until the bank opens?

1099
00:57:39,774 --> 00:57:42,108
- I got doctor bills to pay.
- I need cash.

1100
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:44,110
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1101
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:45,862
How much do you need?

1102
00:57:45,947 --> 00:57:49,449
Hey! I got $2,000.

1103
00:57:50,076 --> 00:57:52,536
Here's $2,000.
This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1104
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,413
- All right, Tom, how much do you need?
- $242.

1105
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:58,041
Tom, just enough to tide you over
until the bank reopens.

1106
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:00,293
I'll take $242.

1107
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:04,881
- There you are.
- That'll close my account.

1108
00:58:04,966 --> 00:58:07,259
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1109
00:58:07,343 --> 00:58:10,720
- Okay. All right, Ed?
- I got $300 here, George.

1110
00:58:10,805 --> 00:58:14,391
Now, Ed, what'll it take
till the bank opens? What do you need?

1111
00:58:14,475 --> 00:58:16,810
Well, I suppose $20.

1112
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:19,729
$20. Now you're talking.
Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1113
00:58:19,814 --> 00:58:21,398
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson,
how much do you want?

1114
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:22,774
But it's your own money, George.

1115
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:24,568
Never mind about that.
How much do you want?

1116
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:26,736
- I can get along with $20, all right.
- $20, fine.

1117
00:58:26,821 --> 00:58:28,947
- And I'll sign the paper.
- You don't have to sign anything.

1118
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:31,157
I know you. You pay it when you can.
That's okay.

1119
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:34,661
- All right, Mrs. Davis?
- Could I have $17.50?

1120
00:58:36,497 --> 00:58:39,874
Bless your heart. Of course
you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1121
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:41,334
- Seven...
- We're gonna make it, George.

1122
00:58:41,419 --> 00:58:42,919
...six...
- They'll never close us up today!

1123
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:47,507
...five, four, three, two,

1124
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:49,759
one, bingo!

1125
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:51,469
We made it! Close the door, Eustace!
We made it.

1126
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:54,472
Look, look, we're still in business.
We've still got 2 bucks left.

1127
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:56,391
Look, let's have some of that.
Let's celebrate!

1128
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:57,892
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1129
00:58:57,977 --> 00:59:01,229
- Well, a couple of financial wizards.
- Call us Rockefellers.

1130
00:59:01,314 --> 00:59:03,815
Get a tray for these two
great big important simoleons here.

1131
00:59:03,899 --> 00:59:05,442
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1132
00:59:05,526 --> 00:59:08,987
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar
and to Papa Dollar,

1133
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:11,197
and if you want to keep this old
Building and Loan in business,

1134
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:12,782
you better have a family real quick.

1135
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:15,702
- I wish they were rabbits.
- I wish they were, too.

1136
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,830
Okay, let's put them in the safe
and see what happens.

1137
00:59:26,255 --> 00:59:27,422
Close the door.

1138
00:59:27,506 --> 00:59:29,424
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1139
00:59:29,508 --> 00:59:32,927
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1140
00:59:33,012 --> 00:59:35,639
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1141
00:59:35,723 --> 00:59:37,891
Look, I got a train to catch.
Well, the train's gone.

1142
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:40,352
I wonder if Ernie's still here
with his taxicab.

1143
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:42,854
George, there's a call for you.

1144
00:59:42,938 --> 00:59:44,272
Look, will you get my wife
on the phone?

1145
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:45,732
She's probably over at her mother's.

1146
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:47,359
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1147
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:49,486
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

1148
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:53,114
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife.
Here, I'll take it in here.

1149
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:56,576
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1150
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:00,705
Huh? Come home? What home?

1151
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:05,210
320 Sycamore? Well, what...
Whose home is that?

1152
01:00:06,045 --> 01:00:08,254
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1153
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:21,851
Hey, this is the company's posters,
and the company won't like this.

1154
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,937
How would you like
to get a ticket next week?

1155
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,355
You got any romance in you?

1156
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:28,024
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it.
- Liver pills.

1157
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:30,610
Who wants to see liver pills
on their honeymoon?

1158
01:00:30,695 --> 01:00:33,113
What we want is romantic places,
beautiful places,

1159
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:35,031
places George wants to go.

1160
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,118
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1161
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:39,452
Come on, we got to get this up.
He's coming.

1162
01:00:39,537 --> 01:00:41,413
- Who?
- The groom, idiot.

1163
01:00:41,497 --> 01:00:43,373
This is their honeymoon.
Come on. Get that ladder.

1164
01:00:43,457 --> 01:00:44,999
What are they, ducks?

1165
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:50,046
- Get that ladder up here.
- All right, all right.

1166
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:52,966
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

1167
01:01:02,017 --> 01:01:04,686
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1168
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:32,607
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1169
01:02:36,862 --> 01:02:39,155
Well, I'll be...

1170
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:47,038
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1171
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:09,811
Oh, Mary.

1172
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:15,733
Remember the night we broke
some windows in this old house?

1173
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:19,195
This is what I wished for.

1174
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:30,039
You're wonderful.

1175
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:53,146
- Martini, you rented a new house?
- Rent?

1176
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,858
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey?
- What's that?

1177
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:58,651
I own the house.

1178
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:02,238
Me, Giuseppe Martini,
I own my own house.

1179
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:05,658
No more we live like a pigs
in this Potter's Field.

1180
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:08,828
- Mary, Mary!
- Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1181
01:04:09,496 --> 01:04:11,289
I feel like a queen.

1182
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:14,459
- I'll take the kids in the car.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1183
01:04:14,543 --> 01:04:17,462
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1184
01:04:17,546 --> 01:04:19,714
Now, one at a time.
Get right up on the seat there.

1185
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:24,928
- Sit down, there.
- Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1186
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:28,348
- Goat, too.
- Everybody!

1187
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:30,016
All in!

1188
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:34,103
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1189
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:37,899
All in?

1190
01:04:56,877 --> 01:04:59,337
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1191
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:02,382
Good old George,
he's always making a speech.

1192
01:05:03,425 --> 01:05:04,759
Hee-haw!

1193
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:08,596
- Sam Wainwright.
- Oh, who cares.

1194
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:12,308
Bread. That this house
may never know hunger.

1195
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,396
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1196
01:05:16,814 --> 01:05:20,274
And wine. That joy and prosperity
may reign forever.

1197
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:22,110
Enter the Martini castle.

1198
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:26,406
Look, Mr. Potter,
it's no skin off my nose.

1199
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:28,324
I'm just your little rent collector.

1200
01:05:28,409 --> 01:05:31,202
But you can't laugh off
this Bailey Park anymore.

1201
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:32,412
Look at it.

1202
01:05:33,288 --> 01:05:35,331
Congressman Black is here
to see you, sir.

1203
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:38,376
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait.
Go on.

1204
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,254
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen
houses stuck here and there.

1205
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,589
There's the old cemetery, squirrels,
buttercups, daisies.

1206
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:45,883
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1207
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,094
Look at it today.

1208
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,055
Dozens of the prettiest little homes
you ever saw,

1209
01:05:51,223 --> 01:05:54,434
90% owned by suckers
who used to pay rent to you.

1210
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:57,854
Your Potter's Field, my dear
Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1211
01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:01,357
And are the local yokels making with
those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1212
01:06:01,442 --> 01:06:03,192
Oh, they are, are they?

1213
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:06,195
Even though they know
the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1214
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,781
You know very well why.
The Baileys were all chumps.

1215
01:06:08,866 --> 01:06:10,825
Every one of these homes is worth

1216
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:13,036
twice what it cost
the Building and Loan to build.

1217
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,538
- If I were you, Mr. Potter...
- You are not me.

1218
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:19,125
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1219
01:06:22,254 --> 01:06:24,213
but one of these days
this bright young man

1220
01:06:24,298 --> 01:06:26,924
is gonna be asking
George Bailey for a job.

1221
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:32,430
The Bailey family has been
a boil on my neck long enough.

1222
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:34,640
- Yes, sir?
- Come in here.

1223
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:37,143
We just stopped in town
to take a look at the new factory,

1224
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,228
and then we're gonna
drive on down to Florida.

1225
01:06:39,313 --> 01:06:40,938
Why don't you
have your friends join us?

1226
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:44,442
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids
drive down with us, huh?

1227
01:06:44,818 --> 01:06:47,570
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1228
01:06:47,654 --> 01:06:49,739
Still got the nose
to the old grindstone, eh?

1229
01:06:49,823 --> 01:06:53,409
Jane, I offered to let George in
on the ground floor in plastics,

1230
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:54,660
and he turned me down cold.

1231
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:57,538
- Oh, now, don't rub it in.
- I'm not rubbing it in.

1232
01:06:57,623 --> 01:06:59,248
Well, I guess we better run along.

1233
01:06:59,333 --> 01:07:01,375
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, too.

1234
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,835
- Goodbye. Glad to see you.
- Goodbye, George.

1235
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,378
So long, George.
See you in the funny papers.

1236
01:07:04,463 --> 01:07:06,547
- So long, Mary.
- Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1237
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:08,633
- Thanks for dropping around.
- Florida!

1238
01:07:08,717 --> 01:07:10,426
- Hee-haw!
- Hee-haw.

1239
01:07:39,706 --> 01:07:41,040
Thank you, sir.

1240
01:07:41,583 --> 01:07:43,584
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
- You like it?

1241
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:45,211
I'll send you a box.

1242
01:07:54,054 --> 01:07:55,346
Well, I...

1243
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:58,391
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

1244
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:01,352
but just what exactly
did you want to see me about?

1245
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:07,066
George, now that's just what I like
so much about you.

1246
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:11,195
George, I am an old man,
and most people hate me.

1247
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,282
But I don't like them, either,
so that makes it all even.

1248
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,534
You know just as well as I do

1249
01:08:16,618 --> 01:08:19,162
that I run practically everything
in this town

1250
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:21,831
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1251
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:26,377
You know, also, that for a number of
years I've been trying to get control of it.

1252
01:08:26,461 --> 01:08:29,088
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

1253
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:31,257
You have been stopping me.

1254
01:08:32,384 --> 01:08:35,511
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1255
01:08:35,596 --> 01:08:40,099
and as anyone in this county
can tell you, that takes some doing.

1256
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:43,895
Take during the Depression,
for instance.

1257
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,064
You and I were the only ones
that kept our heads.

1258
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:51,110
You saved the Building and Loan.
I saved all the rest.

1259
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,863
Yes. Well, most people say
you stole all the rest.

1260
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:57,241
The envious ones say that,
George, the suckers.

1261
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:02,288
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1262
01:09:02,623 --> 01:09:04,790
Now let's look at your side.

1263
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:12,632
Young man, 27-28, married,
making, say, $40 a week.

1264
01:09:12,758 --> 01:09:14,675
- $45.
- $45.

1265
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,885
$45.

1266
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:20,139
Out of which, after supporting
your mother and paying your bills,

1267
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:23,309
you're able to keep, say, $10,
if you skimp.

1268
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:27,730
A child or two comes along, and you
won't even be able to save the $10.

1269
01:09:27,814 --> 01:09:33,361
Now, if this young man of 28
was a common, ordinary yokel,

1270
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:35,029
I'd say he was doing fine.

1271
01:09:35,113 --> 01:09:39,408
But George Bailey is not a common,
ordinary yokel.

1272
01:09:39,493 --> 01:09:43,162
He is an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man,

1273
01:09:43,247 --> 01:09:46,457
who hates his job,
who hates the Building and Loan

1274
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:48,209
almost as much as I do.

1275
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:53,506
A young man who's been dying to get
out on his own ever since he was born.

1276
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:56,759
A young man... The smartest one
of the crowd, mind you.

1277
01:09:56,843 --> 01:09:58,427
A young man who has to sit by

1278
01:09:58,512 --> 01:10:01,973
and watch his friends go places
because he's trapped.

1279
01:10:02,057 --> 01:10:05,726
Yes, sir,
trapped into frittering his life away,

1280
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:08,396
playing nursemaid
to a lot of garlic eaters.

1281
01:10:09,856 --> 01:10:13,192
Do I paint a correct picture,
or do I exaggerate?

1282
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:18,197
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter?
- My point?

1283
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:20,866
- My point is I want to hire you.
- Hire me?

1284
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:24,203
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs,
run my properties.

1285
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:29,542
George, I'll start you out
at $20,000 a year.

1286
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,340
$20,000 a year?

1287
01:10:36,425 --> 01:10:39,802
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1288
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:42,596
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1289
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:45,474
a couple of business trips
to New York a year,

1290
01:10:45,559 --> 01:10:47,393
maybe once in a while Europe.

1291
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:48,811
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, George?

1292
01:10:48,895 --> 01:10:50,229
Would I?

1293
01:10:53,233 --> 01:10:55,568
You're not talking to somebody else
around here, are you?

1294
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,361
You know, this is me.
You remember me?

1295
01:10:57,446 --> 01:10:59,238
- George Bailey.
- George Bailey.

1296
01:10:59,323 --> 01:11:02,408
Yeah, George Bailey,
whose ship has just come in.

1297
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:06,912
Provided he has enough brains
to climb aboard.

1298
01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:16,672
Holy mackerel.

1299
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,303
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1300
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:25,806
Oh, confound it, man,
are you afraid of success?

1301
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:30,853
I'm offering you a three-years contract
at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1302
01:11:30,937 --> 01:11:32,646
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1303
01:11:34,274 --> 01:11:35,941
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1304
01:11:36,151 --> 01:11:39,945
I know I ought to jump
at the chance but I... I just...

1305
01:11:41,073 --> 01:11:45,117
I wonder if it would be possible for you
to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1306
01:11:45,202 --> 01:11:46,869
Sure, sure, sure.

1307
01:11:46,953 --> 01:11:49,538
You go on home
and talk about it to your wife.

1308
01:11:49,623 --> 01:11:51,165
I'd like to do that.

1309
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,584
Yeah. In the meantime,
I'll draw up the papers.

1310
01:11:53,668 --> 01:11:55,586
- All right, sir.
- Okay, George?

1311
01:11:57,089 --> 01:11:58,631
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1312
01:12:06,807 --> 01:12:11,102
No. No. No, no,
now wait a minute, here.

1313
01:12:11,978 --> 01:12:14,814
I don't need 24 hours.
I don't have to talk to anybody.

1314
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:18,651
I know right now, and the answer is no.
No, doggone it!

1315
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,195
You sit around here,
and you spin your little webs,

1316
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,739
and you think the whole world
revolves around you and your money.

1317
01:12:23,824 --> 01:12:25,408
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1318
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:28,661
In the whole vast configuration of things,

1319
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:31,539
I'd say you were nothing
but a scurvy little spider.

1320
01:12:31,623 --> 01:12:32,623
You...

1321
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:36,210
And that goes for you, too!

1322
01:12:40,298 --> 01:12:42,383
And it goes for you, too!

1323
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:52,393
You wouldn't mind living
in the nicest house in town,

1324
01:12:52,853 --> 01:12:55,438
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1325
01:12:55,689 --> 01:12:59,191
going to New York on a business trip
a couple of times a year,

1326
01:12:59,276 --> 01:13:01,527
maybe Europe once in a while.

1327
01:13:02,487 --> 01:13:04,613
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1328
01:13:04,698 --> 01:13:07,908
and the next day and next year
and the year after that.

1329
01:13:07,993 --> 01:13:11,120
I'm shaking the dust
of this crummy little town off my feet,

1330
01:13:11,204 --> 01:13:13,038
and I'm gonna see the world.

1331
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,875
And then I'm gonna build things.
I'm gonna build air fields.

1332
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:18,544
I'm gonna build skyscrapers
100 stories high.

1333
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:21,046
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1334
01:13:22,299 --> 01:13:25,468
What is it you want, Mary?
What, you want the moon?

1335
01:13:26,052 --> 01:13:28,471
If you do, just say the word,
I'll throw a lasso around it

1336
01:13:28,555 --> 01:13:30,306
and pull her down for you.

1337
01:13:30,515 --> 01:13:33,017
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight?

1338
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:35,978
Won't you come out tonight?
Won't you come out tonight?

1339
01:13:36,062 --> 01:13:39,023
Buffalo gal
Won't you come out tonight

1340
01:13:39,107 --> 01:13:40,816
And

1341
01:13:47,574 --> 01:13:49,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1342
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,956
Mary Hatch,

1343
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,253
why in the world
did you ever marry a guy like me?

1344
01:14:02,714 --> 01:14:04,924
To keep from being an old maid.

1345
01:14:05,383 --> 01:14:06,842
You could have
married Sam Wainwright

1346
01:14:06,927 --> 01:14:08,636
and anybody else in town.

1347
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:11,722
I didn't want
to marry anybody else in town.

1348
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,767
I want my baby to look like you.

1349
01:14:14,935 --> 01:14:16,936
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1350
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,395
I promised you...

1351
01:14:19,231 --> 01:14:21,524
- Your what?
- My baby.

1352
01:14:24,277 --> 01:14:25,778
Your... Your...

1353
01:14:26,655 --> 01:14:28,364
Mary, you on the nest?

1354
01:14:28,615 --> 01:14:32,535
- George Bailey lassoes stork.
- Lassoes a stork!

1355
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:40,459
You mean you...
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1356
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:48,592
Now, you've probably already guessed
that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1357
01:14:48,677 --> 01:14:52,429
- No!
- Mary had her baby, a boy.

1358
01:14:53,139 --> 01:14:55,224
Then she had another one, a girl.

1359
01:14:55,475 --> 01:14:57,518
Day after day she worked away,

1360
01:14:57,602 --> 01:15:00,521
remaking the old Granville house
into a home.

1361
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:04,316
Night after night,
George came back late from the office.

1362
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:10,281
Potter was bearing down hard.

1363
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:17,121
Then came a war.

1364
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:21,500
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch
joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1365
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,088
Mary had two more babies
but still found time to run the USO.

1366
01:15:26,298 --> 01:15:29,842
Sam Wainwright made a fortune
in plastic hoods for planes.

1367
01:15:30,135 --> 01:15:32,553
Potter became head of the draft board.

1368
01:15:32,971 --> 01:15:40,728
One-A.

1369
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:43,522
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1370
01:15:43,898 --> 01:15:47,985
Bert the cop was wounded
in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1371
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:51,822
Ernie the taxi driver
parachuted into France.

1372
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:55,326
Marty helped capture
the Remagen Bridge.

1373
01:15:55,702 --> 01:15:56,785
Harry...

1374
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,204
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1375
01:15:59,539 --> 01:16:03,208
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

1376
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:07,630
two of them as they were about
to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1377
01:16:09,257 --> 01:16:11,634
- Yes, but George.
- George?

1378
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:13,802
Four-F on account of his ear,

1379
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:16,388
George fought the battle
of Bedford Falls.

1380
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,224
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1381
01:16:19,309 --> 01:16:20,851
Don't you know there's a war on?

1382
01:16:20,935 --> 01:16:22,728
Air raid warden.

1383
01:16:31,488 --> 01:16:32,946
Paper drives.

1384
01:16:33,031 --> 01:16:34,365
Scrap drives.

1385
01:16:34,449 --> 01:16:35,866
Rubber drives.

1386
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:40,996
Like everybody else on VE Day,
he wept and prayed.

1387
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:46,126
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1388
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:48,379
Joseph, now show him
what happened today.

1389
01:16:48,463 --> 01:16:49,421
Yes, sir.

1390
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:53,342
This morning, day before Christmas,
about 10:00 a.m.

1391
01:16:53,426 --> 01:16:55,010
Bedford Falls time...

1392
01:16:55,095 --> 01:16:57,388
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1393
01:17:02,894 --> 01:17:03,894
It's gonna snow again.

1394
01:17:03,978 --> 01:17:07,272
What do you mean, it's gonna snow?
Look at the headlines. The President...

1395
01:17:07,357 --> 01:17:09,817
I know, I know, George.
That's marvelous.

1396
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:11,402
Commander Harry Bailey!

1397
01:17:11,486 --> 01:17:14,029
Mr. Gower, look at this,
the second page.

1398
01:17:14,114 --> 01:17:15,364
Now, look, this is for you.

1399
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:16,865
- This is for you. That's for you.
- Okay.

1400
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:18,784
- Right, thanks.
- See you again.

1401
01:17:20,453 --> 01:17:22,579
Be sure you spell the name right.

1402
01:17:33,717 --> 01:17:35,217
Extra! Read all about it!

1403
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:37,761
George, George! It's Harry now
on long-distance from Washington.

1404
01:17:37,846 --> 01:17:39,388
Harry! What do you know about that!

1405
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:40,973
He reversed the charges.
It's okay, isn't it?

1406
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:43,350
Reversed the charges?
Of course it is for a hero.

1407
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:44,810
Harry!

1408
01:17:44,936 --> 01:17:48,981
You old seven times
a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1409
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:51,650
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1410
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:53,235
What do you know?

1411
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:55,028
Mother had lunch
with the President's wife.

1412
01:17:55,113 --> 01:17:56,196
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1413
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:58,407
- What did they have to eat?
- What'd they have to eat?

1414
01:17:58,491 --> 01:17:59,533
Harry,

1415
01:17:59,617 --> 01:18:02,745
you should see what they're cooking up
in the town for you.

1416
01:18:02,829 --> 01:18:03,912
Oh, they are?

1417
01:18:03,997 --> 01:18:05,873
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home
this afternoon.

1418
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:07,082
In a plane?

1419
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:09,585
What? Uncle Billy?

1420
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:12,045
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet?
- He stopped at the bank first.

1421
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,591
He's not here right now, Harry.
But look, now, tell me about it.

1422
01:18:15,675 --> 01:18:16,717
- George. George, George.
- What?

1423
01:18:16,801 --> 01:18:17,926
- That man is here again.
- What man?

1424
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:19,595
Bank examiner.

1425
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,806
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute,
will you?

1426
01:18:22,891 --> 01:18:24,099
I'll be right back.

1427
01:18:24,184 --> 01:18:25,642
- Well...
- Harry.

1428
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:28,228
- Good morning, sir.
- Carter, bank examiner.

1429
01:18:28,313 --> 01:18:30,439
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1430
01:18:30,523 --> 01:18:32,274
We're all excited around here.

1431
01:18:32,358 --> 01:18:34,443
My brother just got
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1432
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:37,279
- The President just decorated him.
- Well, I guess they do those things.

1433
01:18:37,363 --> 01:18:40,199
- Well, I trust you had a good year.
- Good year?

1434
01:18:40,408 --> 01:18:43,535
Well, between you and me,
Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1435
01:18:43,745 --> 01:18:45,412
Yeah, very funny.

1436
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:50,375
Well, now,
come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1437
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,711
Although I shouldn't wonder
when you okay reverse charges

1438
01:18:52,796 --> 01:18:54,546
on personal long-distance calls.

1439
01:18:54,631 --> 01:18:56,215
- George, shall we hang up?
- No, no.

1440
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:57,966
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy.
You just hold on, there.

1441
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:00,803
Now, if you'll cooperate,
I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1442
01:19:00,887 --> 01:19:03,764
I want to spend Christmas
in Elmira with my family.

1443
01:19:03,848 --> 01:19:05,098
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1444
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,475
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1445
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,562
December 24.

1446
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:18,737
$8,000.

1447
01:19:19,864 --> 01:19:22,449
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter.
- Merry Christmas.

1448
01:19:22,534 --> 01:19:25,953
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter.
What's the news?

1449
01:19:26,037 --> 01:19:29,790
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey
wins Congressional Medal."

1450
01:19:29,874 --> 01:19:31,959
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1451
01:19:32,043 --> 01:19:35,629
You just can't keep those Baileys down,
now can you, Mr. Potter?

1452
01:19:35,713 --> 01:19:38,131
How does slacker George
feel about that?

1453
01:19:38,216 --> 01:19:39,466
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1454
01:19:39,551 --> 01:19:41,760
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1455
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:43,887
Of course,
slacker George would've gotten

1456
01:19:43,972 --> 01:19:45,848
two of these medals if he had gone.

1457
01:19:45,932 --> 01:19:47,474
- Bad ear.
- Yes.

1458
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:51,103
After all, Potter, some people
like George had to stay at home.

1459
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:55,232
Not every heel was
in Germany and Japan.

1460
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:06,243
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey.
- Good morning, Horace.

1461
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:10,038
- I guess you forgot something.
- Huh?

1462
01:20:10,123 --> 01:20:11,957
- You forgot something.
- What?

1463
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:13,542
Well, aren't you going
to make a deposit?

1464
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:14,626
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1465
01:20:14,711 --> 01:20:18,130
Well, then, it's usually customary
to bring the money with you.

1466
01:20:18,673 --> 01:20:22,885
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1467
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:26,805
How about that finger there?

1468
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:27,973
Well, I...

1469
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:30,058
Bailey.

1470
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:38,984
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1471
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:43,322
Come on, look sharp.

1472
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:02,507
Take me back.

1473
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:15,687
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter.
I got those books for you here.

1474
01:21:15,772 --> 01:21:17,189
Oh, hello, Vi.

1475
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:18,857
George, can I see you for a second?

1476
01:21:18,942 --> 01:21:21,818
Why, of course you can.
Go on in the office there.

1477
01:21:21,986 --> 01:21:24,821
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry.
He's on the telephone.

1478
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:28,408
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry.
Long distance, Washington.

1479
01:21:28,493 --> 01:21:29,618
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1480
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:31,453
You know, your nephew,
remember? Harry.

1481
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:32,788
- Here he is.
- Hurry up.

1482
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:37,042
Hello? Hello.
Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1483
01:21:37,543 --> 01:21:39,753
I ought to have my head examined.

1484
01:21:39,837 --> 01:21:42,714
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1485
01:21:48,888 --> 01:21:50,138
Here you are.

1486
01:21:50,723 --> 01:21:51,807
Character?

1487
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:53,725
If I had any character, I'd...

1488
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:57,229
It takes a lot of character to leave
your hometown and start all over again.

1489
01:21:57,313 --> 01:21:58,814
No, George, don't.

1490
01:21:58,898 --> 01:22:00,899
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1491
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:02,609
- I know, but...
- What do you want to do,

1492
01:22:02,694 --> 01:22:04,486
hock your furs and that hat?

1493
01:22:05,863 --> 01:22:07,322
You want to walk to New York?

1494
01:22:07,407 --> 01:22:09,199
You know, they charge
for meals and rent up there,

1495
01:22:09,283 --> 01:22:10,701
just the same as they do
in Bedford Falls.

1496
01:22:10,785 --> 01:22:12,577
- Yeah, sure.
- No, that's a loan, now.

1497
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:15,163
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1498
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:18,375
Besides, you'll get a job.
Good luck to you.

1499
01:22:18,459 --> 01:22:20,627
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1500
01:22:25,842 --> 01:22:28,593
- Say hello to New York for me.
- Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1501
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:30,595
Now, let's hear from you
once in a while.

1502
01:22:34,559 --> 01:22:37,853
- Merry Christmas, Vi.
- Merry Christmas, George.

1503
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:41,231
- Mr. Bailey.
- Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1504
01:22:41,315 --> 01:22:42,816
I'll be right with you.
Uncle Billy in there?

1505
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,401
Yeah, he's in his office.

1506
01:22:44,485 --> 01:22:46,695
What's going on?

1507
01:22:46,904 --> 01:22:48,905
The bank examiner's here.

1508
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:52,617
- He's here?
- Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1509
01:22:52,744 --> 01:22:54,327
What's the matter with you?

1510
01:22:54,412 --> 01:22:55,829
Come here.

1511
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,059
Eustace.

1512
01:23:17,143 --> 01:23:18,894
- Yeah?
- Come here a minute.

1513
01:23:20,646 --> 01:23:22,898
Did you see Uncle Billy
with any cash last night?

1514
01:23:22,982 --> 01:23:25,484
He had it on his desk counting it
before he closed up.

1515
01:23:26,652 --> 01:23:28,236
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1516
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:30,614
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
- All right, all right.

1517
01:23:30,698 --> 01:23:33,325
Now, we'll go over every step you took
since you left the house.

1518
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:34,409
- Right. This way.
- Come on.

1519
01:23:44,337 --> 01:23:46,338
And did you put the envelope
in your pocket?

1520
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:49,549
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1521
01:23:49,634 --> 01:23:52,427
Maybe! I don't want any maybe.
We've got to find that money!

1522
01:23:52,512 --> 01:23:54,054
- I'm no good to you, George.
- Uncle Billy, look,

1523
01:23:54,138 --> 01:23:56,723
do you realize what's going
to happen if we don't find it?

1524
01:23:56,808 --> 01:23:57,849
Listen to me.

1525
01:23:57,934 --> 01:23:59,726
Do you have any secret hiding place
here in the house?

1526
01:23:59,811 --> 01:24:01,853
Someplace you would have...
Someplace you hide the money?

1527
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:03,563
I've gone over the whole house,

1528
01:24:03,648 --> 01:24:07,567
even in rooms that have been locked
since I lost Laura.

1529
01:24:07,652 --> 01:24:10,779
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1530
01:24:10,863 --> 01:24:14,950
I can't think anymore, George.
I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1531
01:24:15,034 --> 01:24:17,953
Where's that money,
you silly, stupid old fool?

1532
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:20,789
Where's that money?
Do you realize what this means?

1533
01:24:20,873 --> 01:24:23,875
It means bankruptcy and scandal
and prison!

1534
01:24:25,002 --> 01:24:26,294
That's what it means.

1535
01:24:26,379 --> 01:24:29,631
One of us is going to jail.
Well, it's not going to be me.

1536
01:24:52,405 --> 01:24:53,488
Hello, darling.

1537
01:24:53,573 --> 01:24:55,365
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hello, Daddy.

1538
01:24:55,449 --> 01:24:57,325
How do you like it?

1539
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:59,077
- Bless you!
- Bless you!

1540
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:01,997
Did you bring the wreath?

1541
01:25:02,081 --> 01:25:03,915
Yes, Daddy, did you bring
the Christmas wreath?

1542
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
What wreath?

1543
01:25:05,084 --> 01:25:07,544
The Merry Christmas wreath
for the window.

1544
01:25:07,628 --> 01:25:08,962
No. I left it at the office.

1545
01:25:09,046 --> 01:25:11,006
- Is it snowing?
- Yeah, it just started.

1546
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:14,176
- Where's your coat and hat?
- Left them at the office.

1547
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:15,427
What's the matter?

1548
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:18,096
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's all right.

1549
01:25:25,771 --> 01:25:29,065
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy.
You can help me get this star up.

1550
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:32,152
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1551
01:25:32,778 --> 01:25:36,573
All right, fill in that little bare spot
right there. Right there.

1552
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:42,287
Isn't it wonderful about Harry?
We're famous, George.

1553
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:46,124
Bet I had 50 calls today
about the parade, the banquet.

1554
01:25:46,292 --> 01:25:48,376
Your mother's so excited. She...

1555
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:11,483
Must she keep playing that?

1556
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:14,402
I have to practice it
for the party tonight, Daddy.

1557
01:26:14,487 --> 01:26:17,572
Mama said we could stay up
till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1558
01:26:17,657 --> 01:26:19,157
Can you sing, Daddy?

1559
01:26:19,533 --> 01:26:21,117
Better hurry and shave.

1560
01:26:21,202 --> 01:26:24,162
- The families will be here soon.
- Families.

1561
01:26:24,247 --> 01:26:26,706
I don't want the families over here.

1562
01:26:28,501 --> 01:26:31,544
Come on out in the kitchen with me
while I finish dinner.

1563
01:26:31,629 --> 01:26:34,714
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1564
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,967
- Have a hectic day?
- Oh, yeah.

1565
01:26:37,051 --> 01:26:39,970
Another big red-letter day
for the Baileys.

1566
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:43,265
Daddy, the Browns next door
have a new car. You should see it.

1567
01:26:43,349 --> 01:26:45,600
Well, what's the matter with our car?
Isn't it good enough for you?

1568
01:26:45,685 --> 01:26:46,768
Yes, Daddy.

1569
01:26:47,019 --> 01:26:49,437
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1570
01:26:49,522 --> 01:26:51,773
- Excuse you for what?
- I burped.

1571
01:26:52,858 --> 01:26:54,276
All right, darling, you're excused.

1572
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,112
Now, go on upstairs
and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1573
01:26:57,655 --> 01:27:01,950
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu?
- Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1574
01:27:02,034 --> 01:27:03,493
Caught it coming home from school.

1575
01:27:03,577 --> 01:27:06,121
They gave her a flower for a prize,
and she didn't want to crush it,

1576
01:27:06,205 --> 01:27:07,455
so she didn't button up her coat.

1577
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,708
- What is it, a sore throat or what?
- It's just a cold.

1578
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:11,084
- The doctor says it's nothing serious.
- The doctor?

1579
01:27:11,168 --> 01:27:12,919
- Was the doctor here?
- Yes, I called him right away.

1580
01:27:13,004 --> 01:27:14,254
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1581
01:27:14,338 --> 01:27:15,630
Is she running a temperature?
What is it?

1582
01:27:15,715 --> 01:27:17,799
Just a teensy one, 99.6.
She'll be all right.

1583
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:19,342
Of course, it's this old house.

1584
01:27:19,427 --> 01:27:21,636
I don't know why
we don't all have pneumonia.

1585
01:27:21,721 --> 01:27:26,057
Drafty old barn.
Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1586
01:27:26,267 --> 01:27:28,018
Why did we have
to live here in the first place

1587
01:27:28,102 --> 01:27:31,229
and stay around this measly,
crummy old town?

1588
01:27:32,023 --> 01:27:34,607
- George, what's wrong?
- Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1589
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:37,986
You call this a happy family?
Why do we have to have all these kids?

1590
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:41,740
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"?
- I don't know. Ask your mother.

1591
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,575
- Where're you going?
- I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1592
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:46,077
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1593
01:27:56,922 --> 01:28:00,675
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1594
01:28:00,885 --> 01:28:02,260
Hi, Daddy!

1595
01:28:03,387 --> 01:28:06,598
- Well, what happened to you?
- I won a flower.

1596
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,725
Wait now.
Where do you think you're going?

1597
01:28:08,809 --> 01:28:10,477
I want to give my flower a drink.

1598
01:28:10,561 --> 01:28:12,771
All right, all right.
Now, give Daddy the flower.

1599
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:14,189
I'll give it a drink.

1600
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:15,607
Now, here.

1601
01:28:17,109 --> 01:28:19,194
Look, Daddy!

1602
01:28:19,278 --> 01:28:20,695
Paste it!

1603
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,323
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1604
01:28:25,785 --> 01:28:28,328
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1605
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,709
There. There it is. Good as new.

1606
01:28:34,794 --> 01:28:36,878
Now, give the flower a drink.

1607
01:28:36,962 --> 01:28:38,421
Now, will you do something for me?

1608
01:28:38,506 --> 01:28:41,257
- What?
- Will you try to get some sleep?

1609
01:28:41,467 --> 01:28:44,386
I'm not sleepy.
I want to look at my flower.

1610
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:48,890
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep
and then you can dream about it,

1611
01:28:49,183 --> 01:28:51,351
and it'll be a whole garden.

1612
01:28:51,435 --> 01:28:52,685
It will?

1613
01:29:01,112 --> 01:29:02,904
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

1614
01:29:02,988 --> 01:29:04,406
I'll get it.

1615
01:29:06,325 --> 01:29:07,492
Hello?

1616
01:29:08,411 --> 01:29:10,453
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1617
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:13,706
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch.
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1618
01:29:13,791 --> 01:29:15,417
The doctor said
that she ought to be out of bed

1619
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:16,709
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1620
01:29:16,794 --> 01:29:18,336
- Is that Zuzu's teacher?
- Yes.

1621
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:19,754
Let me speak to her.

1622
01:29:19,839 --> 01:29:22,298
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1623
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:25,135
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

1624
01:29:25,219 --> 01:29:26,928
Say, what kind of a teacher
are you, anyway?

1625
01:29:27,012 --> 01:29:29,305
What do you mean
sending her home like that, half naked?

1626
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,933
Do you realize she'll probably end up
with pneumonia on account of you?

1627
01:29:32,017 --> 01:29:33,977
- George!
- Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1628
01:29:34,061 --> 01:29:36,187
to have teachers like you?

1629
01:29:36,272 --> 01:29:39,524
Stupid, silly, careless people who send
our kids home without any clothes on?

1630
01:29:39,608 --> 01:29:41,443
You know, maybe my kids
aren't the best-dressed kids.

1631
01:29:41,527 --> 01:29:43,278
And maybe they don't have
any decent clothes...

1632
01:29:43,362 --> 01:29:45,155
That stupid...

1633
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:48,783
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

1634
01:29:48,868 --> 01:29:50,994
Hello? Hello.

1635
01:29:52,746 --> 01:29:55,165
- She's hung up!
- I'll hang her up!

1636
01:29:55,249 --> 01:29:58,460
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off!
- What is that?

1637
01:29:58,544 --> 01:30:00,336
Hello! Who's this?

1638
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:01,963
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1639
01:30:02,339 --> 01:30:03,798
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1640
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:05,967
Give me a chance to tell you
what I really think of your wife.

1641
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:07,093
George, stop it.

1642
01:30:07,178 --> 01:30:08,887
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1643
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:11,514
Hello? Hello? What?

1644
01:30:13,225 --> 01:30:14,809
Oh, you will, huh?

1645
01:30:14,894 --> 01:30:17,812
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time
you think you're man enough, you...

1646
01:30:17,897 --> 01:30:19,397
Hello! Any...

1647
01:30:23,569 --> 01:30:24,527
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1648
01:30:24,612 --> 01:30:26,654
How should I know?
What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1649
01:30:26,739 --> 01:30:27,989
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1650
01:30:28,073 --> 01:30:29,949
Janie, haven't you learned
that silly tune yet?

1651
01:30:30,034 --> 01:30:33,745
You play it over and over again.
Now stop it! Stop it!

1652
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:02,482
I'm sorry, Mary.

1653
01:31:05,778 --> 01:31:07,654
Janie, I'm sorry.

1654
01:31:08,322 --> 01:31:12,492
I didn't mean that. I...
You go on and practice.

1655
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,416
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1656
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:23,044
I'm sorry.

1657
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:27,298
- What do you want to know?
- Nothing, Daddy.

1658
01:31:34,265 --> 01:31:36,057
What's the matter with everybody?

1659
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:38,685
Janie, go on. I told you to practice.
Now, go on, play!

1660
01:31:38,769 --> 01:31:40,103
Oh, Daddy!

1661
01:31:45,484 --> 01:31:48,945
George, why must you
torture the children? Why don't you...

1662
01:31:49,697 --> 01:31:50,947
Mary...

1663
01:32:05,004 --> 01:32:06,921
Bedford 247, please.

1664
01:32:07,006 --> 01:32:09,048
- Is Daddy in trouble?
- Yes, Pete.

1665
01:32:09,133 --> 01:32:12,218
- Shall I pray for him?
- Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1666
01:32:12,303 --> 01:32:14,345
- Me, too?
- You, too, Tommy.

1667
01:32:15,347 --> 01:32:17,307
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1668
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:19,642
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1669
01:32:20,185 --> 01:32:21,603
I need help.

1670
01:32:22,688 --> 01:32:25,565
Through some sort of an accident,
my company's short in their accounts.

1671
01:32:25,649 --> 01:32:27,442
The bank examiner got there today.

1672
01:32:27,526 --> 01:32:29,777
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1673
01:32:29,862 --> 01:32:32,322
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted
to talk to you about?

1674
01:32:32,406 --> 01:32:33,740
- The reporters?
- Yes.

1675
01:32:33,824 --> 01:32:37,201
They called me up
from your Building and Loan.

1676
01:32:37,494 --> 01:32:40,872
Oh, there's a man over there
from the D.A.'s office, too.

1677
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:42,165
He's looking for you.

1678
01:32:42,249 --> 01:32:45,877
Please help me, Mr. Potter.
Help me, won't you, please?

1679
01:32:45,961 --> 01:32:47,795
Can't you see what it means
to my family?

1680
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,715
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan,
any interest,

1681
01:32:50,799 --> 01:32:52,383
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1682
01:32:52,468 --> 01:32:55,970
George, could it possibly be there's
a slight discrepancy in the books?

1683
01:32:56,055 --> 01:32:57,597
No, sir.
There's nothing wrong with the books.

1684
01:32:57,681 --> 01:33:00,683
I've just misplaced $8,000.
I can't find it anywhere.

1685
01:33:00,768 --> 01:33:04,729
- You misplaced $8,000?
- Yes, sir.

1686
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,444
- Have you notified the police?
- No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1687
01:33:11,528 --> 01:33:15,615
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow...
- They're going to believe that one.

1688
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:17,992
What've you been doing, George?

1689
01:33:18,077 --> 01:33:19,786
Playing the market
with the company's money?

1690
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:20,995
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1691
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:23,081
Is it a woman, then?

1692
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:26,751
You know, it's all over town that
you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1693
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:27,877
What?

1694
01:33:27,961 --> 01:33:30,672
Not that it makes any difference to me,
but why did you come to me?

1695
01:33:30,756 --> 01:33:33,508
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright
and ask him for the money?

1696
01:33:33,592 --> 01:33:35,176
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1697
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:36,678
Well, what about all your other friends?

1698
01:33:36,762 --> 01:33:39,097
They don't have that kind of money,
Mr. Potter. You know that.

1699
01:33:39,181 --> 01:33:41,099
You're the only one in town
that can help me.

1700
01:33:42,309 --> 01:33:45,603
I've suddenly become quite important.

1701
01:33:46,438 --> 01:33:49,107
What kind of security
would I have, George?

1702
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:52,527
- Have you got any stocks?
- No, sir.

1703
01:33:52,611 --> 01:33:55,446
Bonds? Real estate?
Collateral of any kind?

1704
01:33:55,948 --> 01:34:00,159
I have some life insurance,
a $15,000 policy.

1705
01:34:00,244 --> 01:34:03,955
- Yes. How much is your equity in it?
- Five hundred dollars.

1706
01:34:04,123 --> 01:34:05,957
Five hundred dollars?

1707
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:09,001
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1708
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:13,673
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1709
01:34:14,007 --> 01:34:17,093
You were going to go out
and conquer the world.

1710
01:34:17,636 --> 01:34:22,432
You once called me a warped,
frustrated old man.

1711
01:34:23,142 --> 01:34:26,477
What are you but a warped,
frustrated young man?

1712
01:34:27,062 --> 01:34:28,646
A miserable little clerk,

1713
01:34:28,731 --> 01:34:30,398
crawling in here
on your hands and knees

1714
01:34:30,482 --> 01:34:32,358
and begging for help.

1715
01:34:32,568 --> 01:34:34,485
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1716
01:34:34,570 --> 01:34:38,239
Nothing but a miserable
little $500 equity

1717
01:34:38,323 --> 01:34:40,491
in a life insurance policy.

1718
01:34:41,326 --> 01:34:43,745
You're worth more dead than alive.

1719
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:47,206
Why don't you go to the riffraff
you love so much

1720
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:49,834
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1721
01:34:50,252 --> 01:34:51,461
You know why?

1722
01:34:51,545 --> 01:34:54,255
Because they'd run you
out of town on a rail.

1723
01:34:54,339 --> 01:34:57,550
But I tell you
what I'm going to do for you, George.

1724
01:34:57,634 --> 01:35:00,803
Since the state examiner is still here,

1725
01:35:00,888 --> 01:35:03,431
as a stockholder
of the Building and Loan,

1726
01:35:03,515 --> 01:35:06,476
I'm going to swear out
a warrant for your arrest.

1727
01:35:06,852 --> 01:35:10,897
Misappropriation of funds,
manipulation, malfeasance.

1728
01:35:12,524 --> 01:35:14,901
All right, George, go ahead.

1729
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:17,862
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1730
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:20,323
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1731
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:37,381
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1732
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:39,592
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1733
01:35:39,676 --> 01:35:41,385
We got everything.

1734
01:35:52,481 --> 01:35:58,319
Oh, God.

1735
01:36:03,367 --> 01:36:05,243
Dear Father in Heaven,

1736
01:36:08,413 --> 01:36:10,373
I'm not a praying man,

1737
01:36:11,542 --> 01:36:14,460
but if you're up there
and you can hear me,

1738
01:36:16,088 --> 01:36:17,713
show me the way.

1739
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:20,508
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1740
01:36:22,427 --> 01:36:24,387
Show me the way, O God.

1741
01:36:29,268 --> 01:36:32,937
Are you all right, George?
Want somebody to take you home?

1742
01:36:35,607 --> 01:36:37,984
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1743
01:36:38,068 --> 01:36:41,445
Please go home, Mr. Bailey.
This is Christmas Eve.

1744
01:36:41,947 --> 01:36:44,448
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1745
01:36:45,075 --> 01:36:47,118
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1746
01:36:51,331 --> 01:36:54,208
The next time you talk to my wife
like that, you'll get worse!

1747
01:36:54,293 --> 01:36:55,626
She cried for an hour!

1748
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:58,880
It isn't enough she slaves teaching
your stupid kids how to read and write,

1749
01:36:58,964 --> 01:37:01,507
- and you have to bawl her out.
- You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1750
01:37:01,592 --> 01:37:03,050
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1751
01:37:03,135 --> 01:37:04,802
Never mind the money!
You get out of here quick!

1752
01:37:04,887 --> 01:37:07,847
- All right!
- You hit my best friend! Get out!

1753
01:37:13,186 --> 01:37:15,813
- You all right, George?
- Who was that?

1754
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:19,317
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1755
01:37:19,401 --> 01:37:22,194
- He no come into my place no more.
- Oh, Welch.

1756
01:37:22,279 --> 01:37:24,196
That's what I get for praying.

1757
01:37:24,281 --> 01:37:26,324
The last time he come in here.
You hear that, Nick?

1758
01:37:26,408 --> 01:37:27,533
Yes, you bet.

1759
01:37:27,618 --> 01:37:31,037
Where's my insurance policy?
Oh, here it is.

1760
01:37:31,121 --> 01:37:32,830
Oh, no, please,
don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1761
01:37:32,915 --> 01:37:34,582
- I'm all right.
- No, no, you no feel so good.

1762
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:36,042
- Sit down and rest.
- I'm all right.

1763
01:37:36,126 --> 01:37:38,210
Please no go away, please!

1764
01:37:56,688 --> 01:37:59,023
What do you think you're doing?

1765
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:04,987
Now look what you did.
My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1766
01:38:05,864 --> 01:38:07,865
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1767
01:38:08,617 --> 01:38:12,370
Come back here, you drunken fool!
Get this car out of here!

1768
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:23,881
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Look where you're going.

1769
01:39:10,721 --> 01:39:11,846
Help!

1770
01:39:13,432 --> 01:39:21,439
Help! Help!

1771
01:39:24,067 --> 01:39:25,693
Help!

1772
01:39:28,613 --> 01:39:32,533
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1773
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:41,000
Help! Help!

1774
01:39:57,934 --> 01:40:00,227
I didn't have time
to get some stylish underwear.

1775
01:40:00,312 --> 01:40:03,105
Wife gave me this
on my last birthday.

1776
01:40:03,774 --> 01:40:05,524
I passed away in it.

1777
01:40:09,112 --> 01:40:11,989
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1778
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,621
You should read the new book
Mark Twain's writing now.

1779
01:40:19,289 --> 01:40:21,165
How did you happen to fall in?

1780
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:24,418
I didn't fall in.
I jumped in to save George.

1781
01:40:24,711 --> 01:40:27,630
You what? To save me?

1782
01:40:27,839 --> 01:40:30,925
Well, I did, didn't I?
You didn't go through with it, did you?

1783
01:40:31,009 --> 01:40:33,135
- Go through with what?
- Suicide.

1784
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:36,305
It's against the law
to commit suicide around here.

1785
01:40:36,389 --> 01:40:39,225
Yeah, it's against the law
where I come from, too.

1786
01:40:39,309 --> 01:40:41,685
- Where do you come from?
- Heaven.

1787
01:40:46,817 --> 01:40:49,819
I had to act quickly.
That's why I jumped in.

1788
01:40:49,903 --> 01:40:52,321
I knew if I were drowning,
you'd try to save me.

1789
01:40:52,405 --> 01:40:55,366
You see, you did,
and that's how I saved you.

1790
01:40:56,076 --> 01:40:57,493
Very funny.

1791
01:40:57,702 --> 01:40:59,787
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1792
01:40:59,871 --> 01:41:03,958
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw
in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1793
01:41:04,042 --> 01:41:07,878
Oh, no, no, no, George,
I'm the answer to your prayer.

1794
01:41:07,963 --> 01:41:10,297
That's why I was sent down here.

1795
01:41:10,882 --> 01:41:14,051
- How'd you know my name?
- Oh, I know all about you.

1796
01:41:14,136 --> 01:41:15,970
I've watched you grow up
from a little boy.

1797
01:41:16,054 --> 01:41:17,471
What are you,
a mind reader or something?

1798
01:41:17,556 --> 01:41:18,681
No.

1799
01:41:18,765 --> 01:41:22,726
- Well, who are you then?
- Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1800
01:41:23,395 --> 01:41:24,728
Oddbody?

1801
01:41:25,772 --> 01:41:27,898
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1802
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:29,900
Angel Second Class.

1803
01:41:40,287 --> 01:41:42,079
Cheerio, my good man.

1804
01:41:46,251 --> 01:41:47,668
Oh, brother.

1805
01:41:49,963 --> 01:41:51,255
Gee whiz.

1806
01:41:52,257 --> 01:41:55,092
I wonder what Martini
put in those drinks.

1807
01:41:57,137 --> 01:42:01,682
Hey, what's with you?
What did you say just a minute ago?

1808
01:42:01,975 --> 01:42:03,601
Why'd you want to save me?

1809
01:42:03,685 --> 01:42:07,271
That's what I was sent down for.
I'm your guardian angel.

1810
01:42:07,689 --> 01:42:09,815
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1811
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:14,236
Ridiculous of you to think
of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1812
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:17,364
Yeah, now, just things like that...
How do you know that?

1813
01:42:17,449 --> 01:42:21,493
I told you. I'm your guardian angel.
I know everything about you.

1814
01:42:22,495 --> 01:42:25,623
Well, you look about
like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1815
01:42:25,707 --> 01:42:28,667
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you?
What happened to your wings?

1816
01:42:28,752 --> 01:42:32,796
I haven't won my wings yet.
That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1817
01:42:37,093 --> 01:42:38,636
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

1818
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,679
being seen around
with an angel without any wings.

1819
01:42:40,764 --> 01:42:44,391
Oh, I've got to earn them,
and you'll help me, won't you?

1820
01:42:44,476 --> 01:42:45,851
Sure, sure.

1821
01:42:46,353 --> 01:42:48,979
- How?
- By letting me help you.

1822
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:51,982
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1823
01:42:52,067 --> 01:42:54,026
You don't happen to have
8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1824
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,570
Oh, no. No.
We don't use money in heaven.

1825
01:42:56,655 --> 01:42:59,198
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1826
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:03,535
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
- Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1827
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:06,830
I found it out a little late.

1828
01:43:07,207 --> 01:43:09,250
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1829
01:43:09,334 --> 01:43:13,504
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that.
I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1830
01:43:13,588 --> 01:43:17,258
You just don't know all that you've done.
If it hadn't been for you...

1831
01:43:17,342 --> 01:43:20,052
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me,
everybody'd be a lot better off.

1832
01:43:20,136 --> 01:43:22,346
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1833
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:25,683
I mean, look, little fellow, go off
and haunt somebody else, will you?

1834
01:43:25,767 --> 01:43:28,435
No, now, you don't understand.
I've got my job...

1835
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:30,354
Oh, shut up, will you?

1836
01:43:34,234 --> 01:43:36,944
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1837
01:43:41,866 --> 01:43:46,370
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself
would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1838
01:43:48,164 --> 01:43:50,958
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

1839
01:43:52,252 --> 01:43:55,129
I suppose it would have been better
if I'd never been born at all.

1840
01:43:55,213 --> 01:43:58,549
- What'd you say?
- I said I wish I'd never been born.

1841
01:43:58,633 --> 01:44:01,260
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1842
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:06,307
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
That's an idea.

1843
01:44:07,267 --> 01:44:08,934
What do you think?

1844
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:11,353
Yeah, that'll do it.

1845
01:44:12,022 --> 01:44:13,355
All right.

1846
01:44:16,067 --> 01:44:19,278
You've got your wish.
You've never been born.

1847
01:44:24,868 --> 01:44:27,911
You don't have
to make all that fuss about it!

1848
01:44:28,788 --> 01:44:30,205
What did you say?

1849
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:34,168
You've never been born. You don't exist.
You haven't a care in the world.

1850
01:44:34,252 --> 01:44:37,504
No worries, no obligations,
no $8,000 to get,

1851
01:44:37,589 --> 01:44:39,465
no Potter looking for you
with the Sheriff.

1852
01:44:39,549 --> 01:44:43,010
- Say something else in that ear.
- Sure, you can hear out of it.

1853
01:44:43,094 --> 01:44:45,220
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1854
01:44:45,305 --> 01:44:47,848
I haven't heard anything out of that ear
since I was a kid.

1855
01:44:47,932 --> 01:44:50,100
Must have been that jump
in that cold water.

1856
01:44:50,185 --> 01:44:52,936
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1857
01:44:57,609 --> 01:45:01,320
What do you know about that?
What's happening?

1858
01:45:02,781 --> 01:45:05,074
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1859
01:45:05,158 --> 01:45:06,950
What's happened here?

1860
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:09,578
What I need
is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1861
01:45:09,662 --> 01:45:11,955
How about you, Angel?
You want a drink?

1862
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:15,709
Come on,
soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1863
01:45:15,794 --> 01:45:17,753
The clothes are dry.

1864
01:45:17,837 --> 01:45:21,006
What do you know about that?
Stove's hotter than I thought.

1865
01:45:21,091 --> 01:45:25,219
Now, come on, get your clothes on.
We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1866
01:45:25,303 --> 01:45:27,471
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1867
01:45:27,555 --> 01:45:29,098
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1868
01:45:29,182 --> 01:45:31,892
You haven't got your wings.
Yeah, that's right.

1869
01:45:37,524 --> 01:45:38,899
What's the matter?

1870
01:45:38,983 --> 01:45:41,693
Well, this is where I left my car,
and it isn't here.

1871
01:45:41,778 --> 01:45:45,072
- You have no car.
- Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

1872
01:45:45,156 --> 01:45:46,698
I guess somebody moved it.

1873
01:45:46,783 --> 01:45:50,869
- Good evening.
- Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1874
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:53,247
- I beg your pardon?
- My car, my car.

1875
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:55,582
I'm the fellow that owns the car
that ran into your tree.

1876
01:45:55,667 --> 01:45:57,709
- What tree?
- What do you mean, what tree?

1877
01:45:57,794 --> 01:45:59,878
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1878
01:45:59,963 --> 01:46:03,173
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1879
01:46:07,512 --> 01:46:10,973
You must mean two other trees.
You had me worried.

1880
01:46:11,057 --> 01:46:13,267
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1881
01:46:13,351 --> 01:46:14,518
Pottersville?

1882
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:16,228
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1883
01:46:16,312 --> 01:46:19,857
I mean Pottersville.
Don't you think I know where I live?

1884
01:46:20,024 --> 01:46:22,109
What's the matter with you?

1885
01:46:22,193 --> 01:46:25,404
What's the matter with me?
Well, I guess I just...

1886
01:46:27,991 --> 01:46:32,286
Oh, I don't know.
Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1887
01:46:33,288 --> 01:46:34,621
It isn't me.

1888
01:46:34,706 --> 01:46:36,748
Well, maybe I left the car
up at Martini's.

1889
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:39,168
- Well, come on, Gabriel.
- Clarence.

1890
01:46:39,252 --> 01:46:41,044
Clarence. Clarence.

1891
01:46:46,509 --> 01:46:50,345
That's all right. Go on in.
Martini is a friend of mine.

1892
01:46:50,722 --> 01:46:53,390
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1893
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:03,275
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini?
- Want a martini?

1894
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:05,402
No, no, Martini. Your boss.
Where is he?

1895
01:47:05,487 --> 01:47:07,905
Hey, look, I'm the boss.
You want a drink or don't you?

1896
01:47:07,989 --> 01:47:10,199
Okay, all right. Double bourbon,
will you, and quick, huh?

1897
01:47:10,283 --> 01:47:11,533
Okay.

1898
01:47:14,662 --> 01:47:17,748
- What's yours?
- I was just thinking.

1899
01:47:18,917 --> 01:47:21,335
It's been so long since I...

1900
01:47:21,419 --> 01:47:25,088
Look, mister, I'm standing here
waiting for you to make up your mind.

1901
01:47:25,173 --> 01:47:26,798
That's a good man.

1902
01:47:26,883 --> 01:47:29,051
I was just thinking

1903
01:47:29,928 --> 01:47:33,096
of a flaming rum punch.

1904
01:47:33,431 --> 01:47:35,974
No, it's not cold enough for that,
not nearly cold enough.

1905
01:47:36,059 --> 01:47:39,019
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

1906
01:47:39,103 --> 01:47:42,689
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon
and light on the cloves.

1907
01:47:42,774 --> 01:47:44,691
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1908
01:47:44,776 --> 01:47:47,819
Hey, look, mister,
we serve hard drinks in here

1909
01:47:47,904 --> 01:47:49,696
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1910
01:47:49,781 --> 01:47:53,325
And we don't need any characters
around to give the joint atmosphere.

1911
01:47:53,409 --> 01:47:57,037
Is that clear, or do I have
to slip you my left for a convincer?

1912
01:47:57,121 --> 01:47:58,497
What's he talking about?

1913
01:47:58,581 --> 01:48:02,459
Nick, Nick,
just give him the same as mine.

1914
01:48:02,544 --> 01:48:04,878
- He's okay.
- Okay.

1915
01:48:06,297 --> 01:48:09,883
What's the matter with him?
I never saw Nick act like that before.

1916
01:48:09,968 --> 01:48:13,095
You'll see a lot of strange things
from now on.

1917
01:48:13,346 --> 01:48:15,138
Oh, yeah.

1918
01:48:18,309 --> 01:48:21,937
Hey, little fellow,
you worry me, you know.

1919
01:48:22,021 --> 01:48:24,982
- You got someplace to sleep?
- No.

1920
01:48:25,066 --> 01:48:26,608
You don't, huh?

1921
01:48:26,693 --> 01:48:29,319
- Well, you got any money?
- No.

1922
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,905
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1923
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:35,659
I jumped in the river to save you
so I could get my wings.

1924
01:48:39,497 --> 01:48:41,623
- Somebody's just made it.
- Made what?

1925
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:46,503
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means
that some angel's just got his wings.

1926
01:48:54,387 --> 01:48:57,139
Look, I think maybe you
better not mention

1927
01:48:57,223 --> 01:48:58,599
getting your wings around here.

1928
01:48:58,683 --> 01:49:01,101
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1929
01:49:03,688 --> 01:49:05,522
Yeah, they believe in them.

1930
01:49:05,607 --> 01:49:08,900
Oh, why should they be surprised
when they see one?

1931
01:49:10,695 --> 01:49:13,947
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1932
01:49:14,365 --> 01:49:18,368
- How old are you anyway, Clarence?
- Two hundred and ninety-three,

1933
01:49:20,580 --> 01:49:21,872
next May.

1934
01:49:22,457 --> 01:49:25,083
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1935
01:49:25,168 --> 01:49:27,127
Go through the door or out the window.

1936
01:49:27,211 --> 01:49:29,296
- Look, Nick, what's wrong?
- Now, that's another thing.

1937
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:31,340
Where do you come off
calling me Nick?

1938
01:49:31,424 --> 01:49:32,924
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1939
01:49:33,009 --> 01:49:37,137
What's that got to do with it?
I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1940
01:49:37,221 --> 01:49:40,098
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there.
Come here, come here.

1941
01:49:43,561 --> 01:49:47,147
Didn't I tell you never to come
panhandling around here, huh?

1942
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,158
Mr. Gower.

1943
01:49:59,786 --> 01:50:01,536
What... What did...

1944
01:50:01,913 --> 01:50:04,331
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1945
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:07,834
- Don't you know me?
- No.

1946
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,629
No.

1947
01:50:10,713 --> 01:50:12,172
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1948
01:50:12,256 --> 01:50:14,257
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1949
01:50:15,426 --> 01:50:17,678
Hey, Nick. Nick.
Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1950
01:50:17,762 --> 01:50:20,013
You know, that's another reason
for me not to like you.

1951
01:50:20,098 --> 01:50:23,517
That rum head spent 20 years in jail
for poisoning a kid.

1952
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:26,478
If you know him,
you must be a jailbird yourself.

1953
01:50:26,562 --> 01:50:28,605
Would you show these gentlemen
to the door?

1954
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:30,732
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1955
01:50:36,155 --> 01:50:37,447
Stay out.

1956
01:50:38,616 --> 01:50:41,201
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

1957
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:46,373
You see, George,
you were not there to stop Gower

1958
01:50:46,457 --> 01:50:48,166
from putting that poison
into the capsules.

1959
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:51,920
What do you mean, I wasn't there?
I remember distinctly...

1960
01:50:54,132 --> 01:50:56,550
Hey, what's going on around here?

1961
01:50:56,801 --> 01:50:58,176
What...

1962
01:50:59,303 --> 01:51:01,972
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1963
01:51:07,854 --> 01:51:09,521
Look, who are you?

1964
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:12,315
I told you, George.
I'm your guardian angel.

1965
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,651
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1966
01:51:20,241 --> 01:51:23,493
What else are you?
What, are you a hypnotist?

1967
01:51:23,578 --> 01:51:24,745
No. Of course not.

1968
01:51:24,829 --> 01:51:27,414
Well, then, why am I seeing
all these strange things here?

1969
01:51:27,498 --> 01:51:31,918
Don't you understand, George?
It's because you were not born.

1970
01:51:32,003 --> 01:51:36,298
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I?
- You're nobody. You have no identity.

1971
01:51:36,382 --> 01:51:39,050
What do you mean, no identity?
My name's George Bailey.

1972
01:51:39,135 --> 01:51:41,178
There is no George Bailey.

1973
01:51:42,305 --> 01:51:46,641
You have no papers, no cards,
no driver's license,

1974
01:51:47,059 --> 01:51:49,811
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1975
01:51:50,813 --> 01:51:52,814
They're not there, either.

1976
01:51:54,025 --> 01:51:56,359
- What?
- Zuzu's petals.

1977
01:52:01,866 --> 01:52:04,576
You've been given a great gift, George,

1978
01:52:04,744 --> 01:52:08,371
a chance to see what the world
would be like without you.

1979
01:52:10,708 --> 01:52:13,335
Now, wait a minute here.
Wait a minute here.

1980
01:52:15,213 --> 01:52:18,548
This is some sort of a funny dream
I'm having.

1981
01:52:18,716 --> 01:52:20,509
So long, mister. I'm going home.

1982
01:52:20,593 --> 01:52:23,470
- Home? What home?
- Shut up! Cut it out!

1983
01:52:23,971 --> 01:52:28,016
You're crazy!
That's what I think. You're screwy.

1984
01:52:28,434 --> 01:52:31,144
You're driving me crazy, too.
I'm seeing things here.

1985
01:52:31,229 --> 01:52:33,146
I'm going home
and see my wife and family.

1986
01:52:33,231 --> 01:52:36,399
You understand that?
And I'm going home alone.

1987
01:52:38,778 --> 01:52:40,695
How am I doing, Joseph?

1988
01:52:41,405 --> 01:52:42,614
Thanks.

1989
01:52:42,949 --> 01:52:45,033
No, I didn't have a drink.

1990
01:53:36,252 --> 01:53:38,795
Hey, hey, where did
the Building and Loan move to?

1991
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,880
Building and what?

1992
01:53:39,964 --> 01:53:41,715
The Bailey Building and Loan.
It was up there.

1993
01:53:41,799 --> 01:53:43,675
They went out of business years ago.

1994
01:53:43,759 --> 01:53:45,135
That sailor's a liar!

1995
01:53:45,219 --> 01:53:47,512
I know every big shot in this town!

1996
01:53:47,597 --> 01:53:50,140
I know Potter,
and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

1997
01:53:50,224 --> 01:53:51,683
Hey, Violet!

1998
01:53:52,894 --> 01:53:55,478
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

1999
01:53:55,563 --> 01:53:57,689
- I know.
- I know that girl!

2000
01:53:57,773 --> 01:53:59,566
Take a walk. Beat it.

2001
01:54:01,569 --> 01:54:03,320
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2002
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:07,407
Ernie, take me home.
I'm going off my nut.

2003
01:54:07,491 --> 01:54:08,491
Where do you live?

2004
01:54:08,576 --> 01:54:10,660
Now, doggone it, Ernie,
don't you start pulling that stuff.

2005
01:54:10,745 --> 01:54:13,246
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore.
Now hurry up.

2006
01:54:13,331 --> 01:54:16,791
- All right. 320 Sycamore?
- Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2007
01:54:16,876 --> 01:54:18,710
- Come on.
- All right. All right.

2008
01:54:19,337 --> 01:54:21,379
Come on, Ernie,
now straighten me out here.

2009
01:54:21,464 --> 01:54:24,466
Look, I've got some bad liquor
or something. Listen to me.

2010
01:54:24,550 --> 01:54:25,759
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2011
01:54:25,843 --> 01:54:27,594
and you live in Bailey Park
with your wife and kid?

2012
01:54:27,678 --> 01:54:29,721
- That's right, isn't it?
- You seen my wife?

2013
01:54:29,805 --> 01:54:33,058
Seen your wife?
I've been to your house 100 times.

2014
01:54:33,142 --> 01:54:35,936
Look, bud, what's the idea?
I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2015
01:54:36,020 --> 01:54:38,063
my wife ran away three years ago
and took the kid,

2016
01:54:38,147 --> 01:54:40,607
and I ain't never seen you
before in my life, see?

2017
01:54:40,691 --> 01:54:43,485
Okay, well, just step on it.
Just get me home!

2018
01:55:01,003 --> 01:55:03,296
- Is this the place?
- Of course it's the place.

2019
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:06,591
Well, this house ain't been lived in
for 20 years.

2020
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:14,641
- What's up, Ernie?
- I don't know.

2021
01:55:14,725 --> 01:55:17,894
But we better keep our eye on this guy.
He's bats.

2022
01:55:35,371 --> 01:55:37,580
Mary. Mary!

2023
01:55:40,543 --> 01:55:43,420
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu!
Where are you?

2024
01:55:43,879 --> 01:55:46,506
They're not here, George.
You have no children.

2025
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,008
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

2026
01:55:48,092 --> 01:55:50,260
All right, put up your hands.
No fast moves.

2027
01:55:50,344 --> 01:55:51,928
Come on out here, both of you.

2028
01:55:52,013 --> 01:55:54,347
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here.
- Back this.

2029
01:55:54,432 --> 01:55:57,684
Bert, what's happened to this house?
Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2030
01:55:57,768 --> 01:55:59,436
- Watch him, Bert.
- Come on, come on.

2031
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,563
Bert, Ernie.
What's the matter with you two guys?

2032
01:56:01,647 --> 01:56:03,148
You were here on my wedding night.

2033
01:56:03,232 --> 01:56:04,858
You, both of you,
stood out there on the porch

2034
01:56:04,942 --> 01:56:07,235
- and sung to us, don't you remember?
- Think I'd better be going.

2035
01:56:07,319 --> 01:56:08,653
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2036
01:56:08,738 --> 01:56:09,863
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2037
01:56:09,947 --> 01:56:11,906
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Bert, no, listen to me.

2038
01:56:11,991 --> 01:56:13,867
Ernie, will you take me over
to my mother's house?

2039
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:16,411
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here.
He says he's an angel.

2040
01:56:16,495 --> 01:56:19,956
- He's trying to hypnotize me.
- I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2041
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:24,002
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2042
01:56:25,713 --> 01:56:28,506
- Joseph! Help! Help!
- Oh, shut up.

2043
01:56:28,632 --> 01:56:31,468
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2044
01:56:37,266 --> 01:56:40,560
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
I had him right here.

2045
01:56:43,314 --> 01:56:44,856
I need a drink.

2046
01:56:45,316 --> 01:56:47,984
Well, which way did he go?
Help me find him.

2047
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:58,995
Well?

2048
01:57:02,249 --> 01:57:03,458
Mother.

2049
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:07,504
Mother? What do you want?

2050
01:57:08,672 --> 01:57:11,341
Mother, this is George.

2051
01:57:11,675 --> 01:57:13,468
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2052
01:57:13,552 --> 01:57:14,969
George who?

2053
01:57:15,054 --> 01:57:16,930
If you're looking for a room,
there's no vacancy.

2054
01:57:17,014 --> 01:57:20,350
Mother, listen. Please help me.
Something terrible's happened to me.

2055
01:57:20,434 --> 01:57:22,852
I don't know what it is.
Something's happened to everybody.

2056
01:57:22,937 --> 01:57:25,897
Please let me come in,
and keep me here until I get over it.

2057
01:57:25,981 --> 01:57:28,316
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

2058
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,944
unless they're sent here
by somebody I know.

2059
01:57:31,278 --> 01:57:36,282
Well, I know everybody you know.
Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2060
01:57:36,367 --> 01:57:38,076
- You know him?
- Well, sure I do.

2061
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:40,286
- When did you see him last?
- Today over at his house.

2062
01:57:40,371 --> 01:57:41,496
It's a lie.

2063
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:44,457
He's been in the insane asylum
ever since he lost his business.

2064
01:57:44,542 --> 01:57:47,418
And if you ask me,
that's where you belong.

2065
01:57:59,348 --> 01:58:01,015
Strange, isn't it?

2066
01:58:01,475 --> 01:58:04,394
Each man's life
touches so many other lives.

2067
01:58:04,854 --> 01:58:07,814
And when he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2068
01:58:07,898 --> 01:58:09,065
I've heard of things like this.

2069
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:10,900
You got me in some kind of a spell
or something.

2070
01:58:10,985 --> 01:58:13,069
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

2071
01:58:13,154 --> 01:58:14,946
I know how, too. I...

2072
01:58:15,364 --> 01:58:16,489
The last man I talked to,

2073
01:58:16,574 --> 01:58:18,741
before all this stuff
started happening to me, was Martini.

2074
01:58:18,826 --> 01:58:20,034
You know where he lives?

2075
01:58:20,119 --> 01:58:23,037
Well, sure, I know where he lives.
He lives in Bailey Park.

2076
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:31,087
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
- No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2077
01:58:31,964 --> 01:58:34,799
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2078
01:58:35,593 --> 01:58:39,345
- But where are the houses?
- You weren't here to build them.

2079
01:58:43,934 --> 01:58:46,936
Your brother Harry Bailey
broke through the ice

2080
01:58:47,021 --> 01:58:48,897
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2081
01:58:48,981 --> 01:58:51,065
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2082
01:58:51,150 --> 01:58:52,609
He got the Congressional
Medal of Honor.

2083
01:58:52,693 --> 01:58:54,652
He saved the lives
of every man on that transport.

2084
01:58:54,737 --> 01:58:56,779
Every man on that transport died.

2085
01:58:56,864 --> 01:58:58,198
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2086
01:58:58,282 --> 01:59:00,992
because you weren't there
to save Harry.

2087
01:59:12,171 --> 01:59:15,715
You see, George?
You really had a wonderful life.

2088
01:59:16,175 --> 01:59:20,261
Don't you see what a mistake
it would be to throw it away?

2089
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:22,847
- Clarence.
- Yes, George?

2090
01:59:23,849 --> 01:59:27,060
- Where's Mary?
- Oh, well, I can't...

2091
01:59:27,144 --> 01:59:29,687
I don't know how you know these things,
but tell me, where is she?

2092
01:59:29,772 --> 01:59:31,731
If you know where she is,
tell me where my wife is.

2093
01:59:31,815 --> 01:59:34,817
- I'm not supposed to tell.
- Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2094
01:59:34,902 --> 01:59:37,237
- You're not gonna like it, George.
- Where is she?

2095
01:59:37,321 --> 01:59:39,656
She's an old maid. She never married.

2096
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:42,075
Where is Mary? Where is she?
Where is she?

2097
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:45,078
She's just about to close up the library!

2098
01:59:48,958 --> 01:59:52,335
There must be some easier way
for me to get my wings.

2099
02:00:03,847 --> 02:00:15,233
Mary!

2100
02:00:16,652 --> 02:00:18,194
Mary! Mary!

2101
02:00:18,362 --> 02:00:21,114
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me?
What's happened to us?

2102
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:22,532
I don't know you. Let me go!

2103
02:00:22,616 --> 02:00:25,660
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me.
Please, Mary, help me.

2104
02:00:25,744 --> 02:00:27,912
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2105
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:30,373
Help me, Mary!

2106
02:00:30,624 --> 02:00:32,250
Mary! Let me go!

2107
02:00:32,543 --> 02:00:34,252
Help! It's a wild man!

2108
02:00:35,504 --> 02:00:38,172
The wild man is chasing me.
Somebody stop him!

2109
02:00:38,257 --> 02:00:40,842
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2110
02:00:41,552 --> 02:00:42,885
That's my wife!

2111
02:00:45,431 --> 02:00:46,973
- Mary!
- No, you don't.

2112
02:00:47,057 --> 02:00:48,141
Somebody call the police.

2113
02:00:48,225 --> 02:00:49,559
Somebody hit him on the head
with a bottle.

2114
02:00:49,643 --> 02:00:51,769
You need a straightjacket.

2115
02:00:52,896 --> 02:00:54,188
Clarence!

2116
02:00:54,648 --> 02:00:56,232
Get out of here!

2117
02:00:56,317 --> 02:00:57,567
Clarence!

2118
02:00:59,278 --> 02:01:01,738
- Clarence!
- Right, that's you!

2119
02:01:04,867 --> 02:01:06,242
Stand back!

2120
02:01:09,955 --> 02:01:21,716
Clarence!

2121
02:01:26,638 --> 02:01:28,890
Clarence! Clarence!

2122
02:01:30,517 --> 02:01:32,226
Help me, Clarence!

2123
02:01:33,354 --> 02:01:34,771
Get me back!

2124
02:01:35,606 --> 02:01:38,566
Get me back.
I don't care what happens to me.

2125
02:01:38,942 --> 02:01:41,277
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2126
02:01:41,445 --> 02:01:43,529
Help me, Clarence, please.

2127
02:01:44,031 --> 02:01:48,659
Please. I want to live again.
I want to live again.

2128
02:01:50,412 --> 02:01:54,415
I want to live again.
Please, God, let me live again.

2129
02:02:03,467 --> 02:02:04,884
Hey, George!

2130
02:02:06,303 --> 02:02:07,470
George!

2131
02:02:08,514 --> 02:02:10,556
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2132
02:02:10,641 --> 02:02:13,059
Now get out of here, Bert,
or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2133
02:02:13,143 --> 02:02:14,894
What the sam hill
are you yelling for, George?

2134
02:02:14,978 --> 02:02:16,479
You...

2135
02:02:17,815 --> 02:02:20,691
George? Bert, do you know me?

2136
02:02:21,026 --> 02:02:23,027
Know you? You kidding?

2137
02:02:23,112 --> 02:02:25,238
I've been looking all over town
trying to find you.

2138
02:02:25,322 --> 02:02:28,282
I saw your car piled into that tree
down there, and I thought maybe you...

2139
02:02:28,367 --> 02:02:30,618
Hey, your mouth's bleeding.
Are you sure you're all right?

2140
02:02:30,702 --> 02:02:32,203
What did...

2141
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:39,252
My mouth's bleeding, Bert!
My mouth's...

2142
02:02:39,503 --> 02:02:42,588
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2143
02:02:42,673 --> 02:02:45,591
Bert! What do you know about that?

2144
02:02:45,676 --> 02:02:49,429
- Merry Christmas!
- Well, Merry Christmas.

2145
02:02:49,847 --> 02:02:52,974
Mary! Mary!

2146
02:03:01,608 --> 02:03:03,609
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2147
02:03:06,613 --> 02:03:07,989
Merry Christmas!

2148
02:03:08,073 --> 02:03:09,907
- Merry Christmas, George!
- Merry Christmas!

2149
02:03:09,992 --> 02:03:11,868
Merry Christmas, George.

2150
02:03:11,952 --> 02:03:14,370
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2151
02:03:14,913 --> 02:03:17,206
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2152
02:03:18,459 --> 02:03:22,170
Merry Christmas,
you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2153
02:03:26,383 --> 02:03:29,969
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2154
02:03:30,053 --> 02:03:32,763
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2155
02:03:32,848 --> 02:03:34,891
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2156
02:03:36,477 --> 02:03:39,479
Mary! Mary!

2157
02:03:41,190 --> 02:03:42,273
Mary!

2158
02:03:43,192 --> 02:03:46,027
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner!
How are you?

2159
02:03:46,111 --> 02:03:48,321
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit.
- I know, $8,000.

2160
02:03:48,405 --> 02:03:49,864
George, I've got a little paper here.

2161
02:03:49,948 --> 02:03:51,240
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2162
02:03:51,325 --> 02:03:52,992
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2163
02:03:53,076 --> 02:03:55,453
Merry Christmas! Reporters?
Where's Mary?

2164
02:03:55,537 --> 02:03:58,331
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful,
old drafty house.

2165
02:03:58,415 --> 02:04:00,708
Mary! Mary!

2166
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:03,085
Mary.

2167
02:04:03,837 --> 02:04:05,505
Have you seen my wife?

2168
02:04:05,589 --> 02:04:08,466
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2169
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:10,593
Kids! Pete!

2170
02:04:15,265 --> 02:04:16,516
Kids! Janie!

2171
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,100
Janie! Tommy!

2172
02:04:20,229 --> 02:04:23,105
Let me look at you.
Oh, I could eat you up.

2173
02:04:23,857 --> 02:04:24,941
Where's your mother?

2174
02:04:25,025 --> 02:04:26,817
- She went looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.

2175
02:04:26,902 --> 02:04:28,611
- Daddy!
- Zuzu!

2176
02:04:28,695 --> 02:04:31,239
Zuzu, my little gingersnap.
How do you feel?

2177
02:04:31,323 --> 02:04:34,617
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of...

2178
02:04:35,285 --> 02:04:37,286
- Hallelujah!
- Hello.

2179
02:04:37,996 --> 02:04:41,165
- George! George, darling!
- Mary! Mary!

2180
02:04:41,250 --> 02:04:43,459
George, darling. Where have you been?

2181
02:04:43,544 --> 02:04:46,879
- Oh, George, George, George.
- Mary.

2182
02:04:46,964 --> 02:04:50,174
Let me touch you.
Let me touch you. Are you real?

2183
02:04:51,635 --> 02:04:53,761
George, George.

2184
02:04:53,845 --> 02:04:55,763
You have no idea
what's happened to me.

2185
02:04:55,847 --> 02:04:57,848
You've no idea what happened...

2186
02:04:58,725 --> 02:05:00,851
Well, come on, George.
Come on downstairs, quick.

2187
02:05:00,936 --> 02:05:02,270
- They're on their way.
- All right.

2188
02:05:02,354 --> 02:05:03,604
Come on.

2189
02:05:05,983 --> 02:05:07,775
Come on in here now.

2190
02:05:08,944 --> 02:05:10,570
Now, you stand right over here
by the tree.

2191
02:05:10,654 --> 02:05:12,905
Right there, and don't move.
Don't move.

2192
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:14,574
What's happening?
Who's gonna come?

2193
02:05:14,992 --> 02:05:16,325
I hear them coming now.

2194
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:18,828
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

2195
02:05:18,912 --> 02:05:21,122
- What's happening?
- What's happening?

2196
02:05:21,206 --> 02:05:23,207
- Who's gonna come, Daddy?
- Who, Daddy?

2197
02:05:23,292 --> 02:05:26,919
Come in, Uncle Billy.
Everybody, in here.

2198
02:05:27,004 --> 02:05:28,254
George.

2199
02:05:29,715 --> 02:05:31,966
Here's everything right here.

2200
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:36,887
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends.
Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2201
02:05:36,972 --> 02:05:38,556
She told some people
you were in trouble,

2202
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,600
and they scattered all over town
collecting money.

2203
02:05:40,684 --> 02:05:41,767
Didn't ask any questions.

2204
02:05:41,852 --> 02:05:43,561
Just said,
"George in trouble? Then count me in."

2205
02:05:43,645 --> 02:05:45,354
- What is this...
- You never saw anything like it.

2206
02:05:45,439 --> 02:05:47,565
...another run on the bank?

2207
02:05:47,649 --> 02:05:50,109
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2208
02:05:50,193 --> 02:05:52,194
Now, don't crowd. Don't push.
There we are.

2209
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:54,447
The line forms on the right.

2210
02:05:54,781 --> 02:05:56,449
More coming, George.

2211
02:05:56,533 --> 02:05:59,035
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2212
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:01,704
Merry Christmas.

2213
02:06:02,039 --> 02:06:04,457
- Oh, Mr. Martini!
- Merry Christmas.

2214
02:06:04,541 --> 02:06:07,043
Martini! Step right up here.

2215
02:06:07,753 --> 02:06:10,212
I busted the jukebox, too.

2216
02:06:13,383 --> 02:06:14,884
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2217
02:06:17,137 --> 02:06:19,889
I made the rounds
of my charge accounts.

2218
02:06:27,731 --> 02:06:30,775
I'm not gonna go, George.
I changed my mind.

2219
02:06:31,068 --> 02:06:32,526
Violet Bick.

2220
02:06:33,278 --> 02:06:34,987
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2221
02:06:36,198 --> 02:06:38,491
I've been saving this money
for a divorce,

2222
02:06:38,575 --> 02:06:40,576
if ever I get a husband.

2223
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:43,037
Merry Christmas.

2224
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:48,584
There you are, George.
I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

2225
02:06:48,669 --> 02:06:50,961
Here's something for you to play with.

2226
02:06:52,464 --> 02:06:55,633
I wouldn't have a roof over my head
if it wasn't for you, George.

2227
02:06:55,717 --> 02:06:59,220
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2228
02:06:59,304 --> 02:07:01,514
Now, get this, it's from London.

2229
02:07:02,432 --> 02:07:05,017
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2230
02:07:05,227 --> 02:07:09,522
"My office instructed
to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2231
02:07:09,606 --> 02:07:12,608
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas.
Sam Wainwright."

2232
02:07:22,828 --> 02:07:25,287
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2233
02:07:31,253 --> 02:07:34,964
Hark the herald angels sing

2234
02:07:35,048 --> 02:07:39,343
Glory to the newborn king

2235
02:07:39,428 --> 02:07:43,764
Peace on earth and mercy mild

2236
02:07:43,849 --> 02:07:47,935
God and sinners reconciled

2237
02:07:48,019 --> 02:07:52,356
Joyful, all ye nations rise

2238
02:07:52,441 --> 02:07:56,527
Join the triumph of the skies

2239
02:07:56,611 --> 02:08:00,740
With angelic host proclaim

2240
02:08:00,824 --> 02:08:04,410
Christ is born in Bethlehem

2241
02:08:04,494 --> 02:08:05,995
Harry Bailey!

2242
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:13,753
George, you old son of a gun.

2243
02:08:14,004 --> 02:08:16,255
Harry. Harry.

2244
02:08:16,506 --> 02:08:17,673
Looks like I got here too late.

2245
02:08:17,758 --> 02:08:20,384
Mary, I got him here from the airport
just as quick as I could.

2246
02:08:20,469 --> 02:08:22,261
The fool flew all the way up here
in a blizzard.

2247
02:08:22,345 --> 02:08:24,096
Harry, how about your banquet
in New York?

2248
02:08:24,181 --> 02:08:26,807
Oh, I left right in the middle of it
as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2249
02:08:26,892 --> 02:08:28,893
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

2250
02:08:28,977 --> 02:08:32,271
to my big brother, George,
the richest man in town!

2251
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:39,862
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2252
02:08:39,946 --> 02:08:45,451
And never brought to mind?

2253
02:08:45,535 --> 02:08:47,203
Should auld acquaintance

2254
02:08:50,207 --> 02:08:51,290
Be forgot

2255
02:08:51,374 --> 02:08:55,795
And days of auld lang syne

2256
02:08:55,879 --> 02:08:57,296
Who's that?

2257
02:08:58,381 --> 02:09:02,009
That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.

2258
02:09:02,803 --> 02:09:03,969
Look, Daddy!

2259
02:09:04,054 --> 02:09:09,433
Teacher says every time a bell rings,
an angel gets his wings.

2260
02:09:10,227 --> 02:09:13,729
That's right.

2261
02:09:15,232 --> 02:09:16,398
Attaboy, Clarence.

2262
02:09:16,483 --> 02:09:19,151
Auld lang syne

2263
02:09:19,236 --> 02:09:24,615
For auld lang syne, my dear

2264
02:09:24,699 --> 02:09:29,912
For auld lang syne

2265
02:09:29,996 --> 02:09:35,501
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2266
02:09:35,585 --> 02:09:41,340
For auld lang syne

2267
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:47,179
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2268
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:52,768
For auld lang syne
