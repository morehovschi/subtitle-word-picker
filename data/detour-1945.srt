3
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,520
Well, here we are. I turn down here
at the next block.

4
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,500
Thanks, mister. I'll get off there.

5
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,160
- Want anything else?
- No.

6
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,710
Hey, you!

7
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,240
- Me?
- Yeah you. Where're you heading?

8
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,520
East.

9
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,300
Too bad. I thought if you was heading north
I might be able to help you out.

10
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm pushing myself late tonight.
I don't like to ride alone at night.

11
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,470
I am one of those guys who gotta talk
or I fall asleep.

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,000
My partner, he's got Lou to keep him company, but ...

13
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,850
... I ain't got nobody at all.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,290
- Where're you coming from?
- West.

15
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,700
Yeah sure, I know, but ...

16
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,130
... where? LA?

17
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,590
- Maybe.
- I've got a cousin out in LA ...

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
- You don't say.
- Yeah. He's been out ...

19
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,250
You're not much of a talker, are you?

20
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,240
My mother taught me never to speak
to strangers.

21
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,170
- Oh, wise guy is it.
- So what!?

22
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,320
Okay, okay. Don't get sore.

23
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,650
Trying to be sociable. That's all.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,350
Hey, Grandma!

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,440
Give me change for a dime, will you?.

26
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,450
Let's have something quieter this time, Joe.
My head's splitting.

27
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,100
It that what's wrong with it?

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Done with your coffee?

29
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,320
No.
And don't rush me, will you?

30
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,930
Hey, turn that off.
Will you turn that thing off?

31
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,800
- What's eating you now?
- Yeah, what's eating you?

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,880
- That music, it stinks.
- Oh, you don't like it, huh?

33
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,200
- No. Turn it off!
- Now wait a minute, pal.

34
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,700
That was mine, that penny.

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,440
This is a free country,
and I play whatever I want to.

36
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,650
OK.

37
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,850
Sure, and if you don't like it,
you don't have to listen to it.

38
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,750
And you can leave here any time, you want to.

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,450
OK OK. I'm sorry I am.

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,850
First good piece played tonight,
and you don't like it.

41
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,210
Some people just ain't got any good taste.

42
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,800
That tune...  That tune...

43
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,250
Why was it always that rotten tune?

44
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,440
Following me around, beating in my head,
never letting up.

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,380
Did you ever want to forget anything?

46
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,790
Did you ever want cut away a piece of your memory
or blot it out?

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,300
You can't, you know.

48
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,390
No matter how hard you try.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,230
You can change the scenery ...

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,600
... but sooner or later,
you'll get a whiff of perfume or...

51
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,610
... somebody will say a certain phrase,
or maybe hum something ...

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,310
... and you're licked again.

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,860
"I can't believe that you're in love with me”

54
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,930
I used to love that song, once.

55
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,470
So did the customers back in the old
Break O' Dawn Club in New York.

56
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,500
I can't remember a night when I didn't get
at least 3 requests for it.

57
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,850
Sue ...

58
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,100
She was always was selling it too.

59
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,310
Those were the days.

60
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,220
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too

61
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,050
I never knew what they could do

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,770
I can't believe that you're in love with me

63
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,090
You're telling everyone I know

64
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,170
That I'm on your mind each place you go

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,260
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

66
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,190
I have always placed you far above me

67
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,800
I just can't imagine that you love me

68
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,100
And after all is said and done

69
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,190
To think that I'm the lucky one

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,800
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

71
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,020
It wasn't much of a club, really.
You know the kind.

72
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,220
A joint where you could have a sandwich
and a few drinks ...

73
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,370
... and run interference for your girl
on the dance floor.

74
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,160
I fronted the piano in there every night
from 8:00 until the place closed up ...

75
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,370
... which usually meant 4:00 in the morning.

76
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,570
A good job, as jobs went in those days.

77
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,090
And then too ...

78
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,620
... there was Sue.

79
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:27,060
... who made working there a little like working in heaven.

80
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,560
But how we felt about each other.
Well, there was nothing very unusual in that.

81
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,590
I was an ordinary healthy guy,
and she was an ordinary healthy girl.

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,050
And when you add those two together,
you get an ordinary healthy romance.

83
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,950
Which is the old story ...

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,290
... sure, but somehow ...

85
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,650
... the most wonderful thing in the world.

86
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,170
All in all, I was a pretty lucky guy.

87
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,330
Mr Paderewsky, I presume ...

88
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,350
It's beautiful.

89
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,590
You're going to make Carnegie Hall your door.

90
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,260
Yeah, as a janitor.

91
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,100
I'll make my debut in the basement.

92
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,260
I don't blame you for being bitter, darling but ...

93
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,920
... you mustn't give up hope.

94
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,790
- Why, some day ...
- Yeah, some day ...

95
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,390
... if I don't get arthritis first.

96
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,530
In the meantime, let's blow this trap.

97
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,630
- Like to get something to eat, hon'?
- I don't think so, Al.

98
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,810
I lose my appetite working in this fleabag.

99
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,660
- Let's go home.
- OK.

100
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,330
I can't stand much more of that dump.

101
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,010
Did you see that drunk tonight trying to paw me.

102
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,210
No, what drunk?

103
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,330
It doesn't matter what drunk!

104
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,690
Say, what's the matter with you tonight, darling?

105
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,120
That's the third time you started
to tell me something and then stopped.

106
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,720
We shouldn't have any secrets from each other, Sue.

107
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,220
Next week, we're going to make with the ring and
the license. You and me. We'll be a team.

108
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,350
Yes, that's right. In the Bush League.

109
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,410
- I don't get you.
- We've been struck out.

110
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,210
A funny way to talk, darling.

111
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,390
- Don't you want to marry me?
- Al, look, I love you, you know I do.

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,130
- And I want to marry you.
- But ...

113
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,640
But not now.

114
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,320
Only after we do good.

115
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,490
Someday, I'm going away.

116
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,470
Oh, I know you'll think it silly ...

117
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,750
That's why I hesitated to tell you.
But I'm going to California ...

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,220
I want to try my luck in Hollywood.

119
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,680
That's the most stupid thing, I ever heard of.

120
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,300
Don't you know millions of people go out there
every year and wind up polishing cuspidors?

121
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,520
I thought you had better sense.

122
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,500
You sound as if you don't think I have any talent.

123
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,810
That has nothing to do with it.

124
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,850
- I'll make out alright.
- Maybe. But what about me?

125
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,470
Doesn't it mean anything to you that
you're busting up all our plans.

126
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,950
- We may not see each other for years.
- It won't be that long.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,590
- I thought you loved me.
- I do, you know I do.

128
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,370
Well ... here we are.

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,920
Al ...

130
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,450
Al, why can't you see my side of it?

131
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm young. We both are.

132
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,410
And we've got all the time in the world to settle down.

133
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,930
Really, darling ...

134
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,710
... what I'm doing is the only sane thing to do.

135
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I ...
I hate the thought of being so far away from you, but ...

136
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,850
But we'll be together again someday.

137
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,960
Maybe you'll decide to come out too, later on.

138
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,350
So long.

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,040
Al ...

140
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,870
Aren't you going to kiss me goodnight?

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,690
Sure, why not?

142
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,560
Good night.

143
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,210
Say Roberts, you hit the jackpot this time ...

144
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,970
Ten bucks.

145
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,410
Thanks.

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,750
But when a drunk handed me a ten spot,
after a request ...

147
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,390
... I couldn't get very excited.

148
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,120
What was it? I asked myself.
A piece of paper crawling with germs.

149
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,700
It couldn't buy anything I wanted.
It couldn't ...

150
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,550
Then I thought of something.

151
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,570
Long distance.
I'd like to put a call through to Los Angeles.

152
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,660
Miss Harvey, Sue Harvey. H-A-R-V-E-Y.

153
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,710
The number is: Crest View 65723.

154
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,400
Fifty ... seventy five ... eighty five.

155
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,920
Hello Sue? This is Al.

156
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,150
Oh baby, it's great to hear from you too.

157
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
What's that? You do?

158
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,520
Oh, me too, darling.

159
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,220
I thought I'd go batty without you.
I just had to ...

160
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,460
Huh? ... You're working as a hash slinger?

161
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,640
Gee honey, that's tough.

162
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,270
Those guys out in Hollywood don't know the real thing
when it's right in front of them.

163
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,010
You just stick it out too, baby.

164
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,700
Keep going around to those casting offices.
I'm sure you'll click.

165
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,730
Look, I'll tell you what. You stay put out there.
I'll come to you.

166
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,470
No, do not try to stop me.
Just expect me.

167
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,270
Train? Who knows. Train, plane, bus, magic carpet.
I'll be there if I have to crawl.

168
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,740
If I have to travel by pogo stick.
And then ...

169
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,880
... let's get married right away, huh?

170
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,240
That's the stuff.
That's what I've been wanting to hear you say.

171
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,110
Well ... goodbye for now.

172
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,050
I'll be seeing you soon.

173
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,120
Yeah.

174
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,450
‘Bye.

175
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,120
The only way I could cross country was to thumb rides.

176
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,880
For even after hawking everything,
I only had enough money to eat.

177
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,250
Money. You know what that is.

178
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,400
The stuff you never have enough of.
Little green things with ...

179
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,770
... George Washington's picture
that men slave for ...

180
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,830
... commit crimes for, die for.

181
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,900
It's the stuff that has caused more
trouble in the world ...

182
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,050
... than anything else we ever invented.

183
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,930
Simply because, there's too little of it.

184
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,210
At least, I had too little of it.

185
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,800
So it was me for the thumb.

186
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,750
Ever done any hitchhiking?

187
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,260
It's not much fun, believe me.

188
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,630
Oh yeah, I know all about how it's an education ...

189
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,630
... how to get to meet a lot of people
and all that. But me ...

190
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,050
... from now on, I'll take my education
in college, or in PS-62, or I'll...

191
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,800
... send $ 1.98 in stamps for “Ten Easy Lessons”.

192
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,950
Thumbing rides may save your busfare,
but it's dangerous.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,380
You never know what's in store for you,
when you hear the...

194
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,620
... squeal of brakes.

195
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,250
If only I had known what I was getting into,
that day in Arizona.

196
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,560
Here, throw that in the back seat.

197
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,260
Okay, let's go. Make sure that door's closed.

198
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,770
You know, Emily Post ought to write a ...

199
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,580
... book of rules for guys thumbing rides.

200
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,370
Because, as it is now, you never know
what's right and what's wrong.

201
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,320
We rode along for a little while, neither one
of us saying anything.

202
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,300
I was glad of that.

203
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,950
I never know what to say to strange people
driving cars.

204
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,210
Then too, you can never tell if a guy wants to talk.

205
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,460
A lot of rides have been cut short
because of a big mouth.

206
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,230
So I kept my mouth shut until
he started opening up.

207
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,310
Hand me that little box in the compartment,
will ya pal.

208
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,650
Hold the wheel, will you.

209
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,200
- How far are you going?
- L.A.

210
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,350
Well, you're really travelling, aren't you?

211
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah, but I don't expect to make it
for a couple of years ...

212
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,160
... at the rate I've been sporting rides.

213
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,240
- Not much luck, huh?
- Sure, all bad.

214
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,990
Not many people stop for a guy these days.
Afraid of a stick up, maybe.

215
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,100
Well, you can't blame them.

216
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,390
- Where are you coming from?
- New York.

217
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,500
Well, New York!

218
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,870
Well, you're in luck this time.
I'm going all the way.

219
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,680
Right through to Los Angeles.

220
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,700
- You drive a car?
- Sure, if you're tired, let me know.

221
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,330
I'll holla.

222
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,480
I guess at least an hour passed before
I noticed ...

223
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,900
... those deep scratches
in his right hand.

224
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,410
They were wicked.

225
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,180
Three puffy red lines, about a quarter
of an inch apart.

226
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,610
He must have seen me looking at them,
because he said ...

227
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,760
Beauties, aren't they?

228
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,320
They're going to be scars some day.

229
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,660
What an animal!

230
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,970
Whatever it was, it must have been
pretty big and vicious to have done that.

231
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,120
Right on both counts, New York.

232
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,220
I was tussling with the most dangerous animal
In the world...

233
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,050
... a woman.

234
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,680
Must have been Tarzan's mate.

235
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,580
Looks like, you lost the bout.

236
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,100
It certainly wasn't a draw.

237
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,100
You know, there should be a law
against dangerous claws.

238
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.

239
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,900
I tossed her out of the car on her ear.

240
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,390
Was I wrong?

241
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,270
Give a lift to a tomato, you expect her
to be nice, don't you?

242
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,920
- Yeah.
- After all, what kind of a dame, thumbs rides?

243
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,610
- Sunday school teacher?
- Yeah.

244
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,460
A little witch.

245
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,590
Must have thought, she was riding
with some fall guy.

246
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,550
Not me who's been booking horses around race tracks,
since I was twenty.

247
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,050
Ahh, I've known a million dames like her.

248
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,260
- Two million.
- Yeah.

249
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,960
Stopped the car, opened the door ...

250
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,170
"Take another hour and stop here, sister", I told her.

251
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,100
- That's the stuff
- As I was going on.

252
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,280
If you want to see a real scar, brother,
get a load of this.

253
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,730
Wow

254
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,870
- I got that one duelling.
- Duelling?

255
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,080
Yeah, just kidding of course.
My dad owned a couple of Franco-Prussian sabres.

256
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,880
Kept them on the wall for decoration.

257
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:08,010
Well one day, another kid and I took them down,
and the old man wasn't around... Had a duel.

258
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,240
He hit me in the arm here.

259
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,580
Pretty mean cut. Infection set in later.

260
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,570
Yeah, I can see that.

261
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,100
- Oh, give me that box again, will ya.
- Yeah.

262
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,300
Pain made me lose my head, I guess...
Began slashing ...

263
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,100
Before I knew it, I'd put the other kid's eye out.

264
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,610
That was tough.

265
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,150
Oh, it was just an accident, of course.
You know how kids are.

266
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,420
I got scared and decided I was going to
run away from home.

267
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,420
Old man almost caught me, when I was
packing my duds.

268
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,850
The bloody rag I had wrapped around my wrist
hadn't caught his attention ...

269
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,730
... he'd have seen the bundle for sure.

270
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,780
So I beat it, when he was phoning for a doctor.

271
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,230
That was fifteen – sixteen years ago.

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,710
I haven't been home since.

273
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,000
Pull in there for a bite of something, huh?
I'll buy you ...

274
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,990
Brother, was I hungry.
I hadn't had anything in my stomach for hours.

275
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,980
But even with that gnawing in the pit of my belly.

276
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,520
I didn't want to be in too big a rush
to put on the feed bag.

277
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,380
First, I had to make sure this guy knew the score.

278
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,170
If I got him down on me, goodbye ticket to Hollywood.

279
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,550
- I'll wait out here for you, mister.
- If it's the money, don't worry about paying for it.

280
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,720
This time it's on me.

281
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,000
- Well, that's quite ...
- Haskell. Think nothing of it.

282
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,470
You make your first million, maybe you can
do the same for me. Come on, New York.

283
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,220
I gotta make the West Coast by Wednesday.

284
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,050
There's a horse running at Santa Anita,
named "Paradisical" ...

285
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,860
- Means dough to for me, if I'm on it.
- You'll make it, alright

286
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,520
He did most of the talking, during the half hour
we were in the place.

287
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,570
I ate.

288
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,670
He rambled on about his old man, whom he hadn't
heard from since he ran away as a kid,...

289
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,680
... and how he happened to become a bookie.

290
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,380
And then all about how he got rooked in Miami.

291
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,330
One race, 38 grand. They cleaned out my book.

292
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,790
- How do you like that?
- It was tough luck.

293
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,580
Yeah, and I'm supposed to be the smart guy.
You just wait ...

294
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,150
I'm going back to Florida, next season,
with all kinds of jack.

295
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,180
And you watch those stinkers run for cover.

296
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,980
- Want anything else?
- No thanks, I've had plenty.

297
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,880
Got the cheque there, sister?

298
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,230
Oh, just a minute! Your change, sir.

299
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,020
- Keep it, sister.
- Oh, thank you, sir. Call again.

300
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,250
I'll be waiting outside for you,
when you've finished work.

301
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,240
Sharp chick, huh?

302
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,160
I drove all that night, while Haskell
slept like a log.

303
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,450
After a while, I began to get sleepy myself.

304
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,370
I was happy though.

305
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,500
Soon I'd be with Sue again.

306
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,320
The long trip was practically over, and there'd be
no more hoofing it down the concrete.

307
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,700
I began to think of the future ...

308
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,570
... which couldn't have been brighter
if I'd embroidered it with neon lights.

309
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,300
It was nice to think of Sue, shooting to the top.

310
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,420
Hmpf ... It's amazing what a full belly can do
to your imagination.

311
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,790
Your eyes of blue, your kisses too

312
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,210
I never knew what they could do

313
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:36,660
I can't believe that you're in love with me

314
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,270
You're telling everyone I know

315
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,730
I'm on your mind each place you go

316
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:57,850
I can't believe that you're in love with me

317
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,230
Mister Haskell.

318
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,110
Mister Haskell.

319
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,380
Mister Haskell, wake up. It's raining.

320
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,240
Don't you think we ought to stop
and put up the top?

321
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,880
Mister Haskell, I'm going to put up the top.

322
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,330
So far, things had been my way ...

323
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,670
... but from then on something else
stepped in and shunted me off ...

324
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
... to a different destination than
the one I picked for myself ...

325
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,680
... for when I pulled open that door ...

326
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,060
Mr Haskell, what's the matter?
Are you hurt?

327
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,780
Are you hurt, Mr Haskell?

328
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,030
Doubtless ... I'll listen to it.

329
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,390
... but I know what you're going to hand me
even before you open your mouth.

330
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,950
You're going to tell me you don't believe my story
about Haskell died ...

331
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,960
... and give me that "don't make me laugh"
expression on your smug faces.

332
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,080
I saw at once he was dead ...
and I was in for it.

333
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,900
Who would believe that he fell out of the car?

334
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,260
Why if Haskell came to, which of course he couldn't,
even he would swear ...

335
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,220
... I conked him over the head for his dough.

336
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,930
Yes, I was in for it.

337
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,810
Instinct told me to run, but then
I realised it was hopeless.

338
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,900
There were lots of people back down the road
who could identify me.

339
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,000
That gas station guy and the waitress.

340
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,430
I would be in a worse spot then,
trying to explain why I beat it.

341
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,350
The next possibility was to sit tight and
tell the truth when the cops came.

342
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,860
But that would be crazy. They'd laugh at
the truth, and I'd have my head in a noose.

343
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,800
So what else was there to do, but hide the body
and get away in the car?

344
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,100
I couldn't leave the car there with him in the gully.

345
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:02,410
That would be like erecting a tombstone.

346
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,620
My idea was to cover him with brush, not to rob him.

347
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,300
But then I remembered that even if I only drove
the car for a hundred miles or so ...

348
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,980
... I would need money for gas.

349
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,050
Besides, it was stupid of me
to leave all that money on a dead man.

350
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,800
Not only that. I'd have to take his drivers license
in case I was stopped or something.

351
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,790
I didn't like to think about it, but by that time
I'd done just what the police would say I did ...

352
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,970
... even if I didn't.

353
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,630
My clothes. The owner of such an expensive car
would never be wearing them.

354
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,050
Some cop might pull me in under suspicion.

355
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,820
Hey you, this your car?

356
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,920
Don't you know better than to leave a car with
the wheels half way in the middle of the road?

357
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,500
That's the way accidents happen.

358
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,710
I ... I'm sorry officer. I was just putting up my top.

359
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,300
- I didn't think.
- Well, the next time think.

360
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,900
I'll let you go now,
but watch your step in the future.

361
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,490
I know that's a lonely stretch, but cars come by here
once and a while, and ...

362
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,580
... we have plenty of crack ups.

363
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,460
Thanks officer.

364
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,850
I left nothing in the car that would
give me away as Roberts.

365
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,040
If they found a dead man in the gully now,
it would be me.

366
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,930
As I drove off, it was still raining ...

367
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,800
... and the drops streaked down the windshield
like tears.

368
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,630
I kept imagining I was being followed and
that I could hear sirens back in the distance.

369
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,430
Just how long it took me to cover
the 60 odd miles to the California state line ...

370
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,910
... I don't know.

371
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,220
I lost all track of time.

372
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:51,060
But the rain had stopped and the sun was up
when I pulled up to the inspection station.

373
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,870
- Hello. Carrying any fruits or vegetables?
- No.

374
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,620
- Any livestock or poultry?
- No.

375
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:06,300
I'd like to see your registration and
and driver's license, please.

376
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,050
- Anything in the baggage compartment?
- Just baggage.

377
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,610
Charles Haskell Jr, age 30,
brown eyes, dark hair ...

378
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,640
... identifying marks, none.

379
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,930
- Are you Charles Haskell Jr?
- Yes.

380
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,220
Well, remember that if you're employed
and stay over than 30 days ...

381
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,060
... you take out California plates.

382
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,930
Alright officer, but I'll only be in the
state a short while.

383
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,190
Right, you can go now.

384
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,520
I couldn't drive any further without any sleep.
Cops or no cops ...

385
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,870
... I knew I had to hit the hay and hit it hard.

386
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,860
I was dead tired.

387
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
No ... No you can't, Mr Haskell.

388
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,250
No.

389
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,180
Mr Haskell, you can't die.

390
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,360
They'll think ... that I did it.

391
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,230
No, Mr Haskell. No ... no.

392
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,830
- Who's there?
- It's the maid. Can I can come in and clean?

393
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,260
Later.

394
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:06,070
- In a half hour.
- Alright, sir.

395
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,300
There was no time to lose.
Every minute I had to be Charles Haskell was dangerous.

396
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,650
And I'd have to be Charles Haskell, until I got
to some city ...

397
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,560
... where I could leave the car and be swallowed up.

398
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,900
That meant driving the car as far as San Bernardino ...

399
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,510
... maybe even to Los Angeles.

400
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,450
In a little town, I might be noticed ...

401
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
... but in a city, I should be safe enough.

402
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,480
Then after I ditched the car, I could go on to Sue.

403
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,700
But those five minutes at the state line ...

404
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,530
... made me realise, it might be a good idea
to find out a little bit about Mr Haskell.

405
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,230
Then if anyone asked me questions
I could give the right answers.

406
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,540
The first thing I found out was
that I had $768.

407
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,750
This was a lot of jack. But believe me ...

408
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,550
... it was the kind of money
I'd rather not have.

409
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,100
And then I found out from a letter
Haskell was carting around in his bag ...

410
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,820
... that he wasn't the open-handed
easy going big shot ...

411
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,010
... who went around buying dinners for strange
hitchhikers.

412
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,100
Before I got done reading it, I saw him more
as a chiseller.

413
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:40,830
It was written to his old man in California ...

414
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,500
... the one he hadn't seen in so many years.

415
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,970
In it Haskell posed as a salesman ...

416
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,570
... of hymnals, of all things.

417
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,450
It was easy to see where Haskell expected
to raise the new stake ...

418
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,540
... for his book in Miami.

419
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,640
By rooking his old man.

420
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,650
That was about all I found out from his effects ...

421
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,530
... and it was enough.

422
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,810
I told myself maybe old man Haskell
was lucky his son kicked off.

423
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,900
He would never know it, but it saved him from taking
a flyer on sacred literature preferred.

424
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,580
Near the airport of Desert Centre,
I pulled up for water.

425
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,620
There was a woman.

426
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,320
Hey you! Come on, if you want a ride.

427
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,630
- How far are you going?
- How far are you going?

428
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,810
That took me by surprise, and I turned
turned my head to look her over.

429
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,860
She was facing straight ahead,
so I couldn't see her eyes.

430
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,870
But she was young, not more than 24.

431
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,120
Man, she looked as if she'd just been thrown off
the crummiest freight train in the world.

432
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,650
Yet in spite of this, I got the impression of beauty.

433
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,050
Not the beauty of a movie actress, mind you ...

434
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,670
... or the beauty you dream about when
you're with your wife.

435
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,450
But a natural beauty.

436
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,240
A beauty that's almost homely, because it's so real.

437
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,270
Then suddenly she turned to face me.

438
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,370
- How far did you say we're going?
- Los Angeles.

439
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:21,260
L.A.? ... L.A's good enough for me, mister

440
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,060
- That's what I was afraid of.
- What did you say?

441
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,150
Oh nothing. Just thinking out loud.

442
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,940
People get in trouble for doing that.

443
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,320
- What's your name?
- You can call me Vera, if you like.

444
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:35,950
- Do you live in Los Angeles?
- No.

445
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,580
- Where are you coming from?
- Oh, back there.

446
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,010
- Needles?
- No.

447
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,590
Oh sure, Phoenix.
You look just like a Phoenix girl.

448
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,960
Are the girls in Phoenix that bad?

449
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,720
The girl must have been pretty tired,
because she fell asleep ...

450
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,610
... not twenty minutes after she stepped
into the car.

451
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:57,350
She lay sprawled out with her head resting
against the far door like Haskell.

452
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,850
I didn't like that part of it much
but I didn't wake her up.

453
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,300
It wasn't that this girl still worried me.

454
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,450
I'd gotten over that funny feeling I had,
when she looked at me ...

455
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,530
... which I put down as just my jangled nerves.

456
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,700
With her eyes closed, and the tempest gone out of them

457
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,840
She seemed harmless enough.

458
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,570
Instead of disliking her, I began to feel sorry for her.

459
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,360
The poor kid probably had had a rough time of it.

460
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,500
Who was she anyway?
And why was she going to Los Angeles?

461
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,940
And where'd she come from in the first place.

462
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,720
The only thing I knew about her was her name.

463
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,740
Not that it made any difference.
A few hours more, we'd be in Hollywood.

464
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,050
I'd forget where I parked the car
and look up Sue.

465
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,020
This nightmare of being a dead man would be over.

466
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,840
Who this dame was, well it was no business of mine.

467
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,480
Where did you leave his body?

468
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:52,220
Where did you leave the owner of this car?
You're not fooling anyone.

469
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,250
This buggy belongs to a guy named Haskell.
That's not you, mister.

470
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,510
You're out of your mind, that's my name,
Charles Haskell. I can prove it.

471
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
- My driver's license.
- Save yourself the trouble, mister.

472
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,840
Having Haskell's wallet only makes it worse.

473
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,730
It just so happens I rode with Charlie Haskell
all the way from Louisiana.

474
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,900
He picked me up outside of Shreveport.

475
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,100
- You rode ...
- You heard me.

476
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,160
Then it all came back to me.

477
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,500
All the talk about duelling and scars and scratches.

478
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,390
There was no doubt about it.

479
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,050
Vera must be the woman Haskell had mentioned.

480
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,830
She must have passed me while I slept.

481
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,970
Well? ... Well, I'm waiting.

482
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,780
My goose was cooked. She had me.

483
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,200
That Haskell guy wasn't dead yet.

484
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,300
He wasn't stretched out stiff and cold
in any Arizona gully.

485
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:40,300
He was sitting right there in the car
laughing like mad while he haunted me.

486
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,350
Well?

487
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,200
There was nothing I could say.
It was her move.

488
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,150
Vera or whatever her name was ...

489
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,270
It was just my luck, picking her up on the road.

490
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,920
Couldn't have been Helen or Mary or Evelyn or Ruth.

491
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,760
It had to be the very last person,
I should ever have met.

492
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,620
That's life.

493
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,860
Whichever way you turn,
fate sticks out a foot to trip you.

494
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,470
I told her everything,
but she didn't believe my story.

495
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,210
I should have saved my breath.

496
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,750
That's the greatest cock-and-bull story I ever heard.

497
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,530
So he fell out of his car? Say, who do you think
you're talking to? A hick?

498
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,790
Listen mister, I've been around, and I know
a wrong guy when I see one.

499
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,270
What did you do? Kiss him with a wrench?

500
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,900
Now wait a minute, what I told you is true.
You see that's why I had to do it?

501
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,500
You think I killed him.
Well, the cops would have thought so too.

502
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,030
Yeah, well maybe they still think so.

503
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,500
What makes you so sure, I'll shut up about this.

504
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,960
Vera, I'm innocent. Give me a break will you?

505
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,030
It won't do me any good having you fenced.
The cops are no friends of mine.

506
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,020
Now, if there was a reward ...
But there isn't.

507
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,790
Thanks.

508
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,540
Don't thank me yet, I'm not through with you
by a long shot.

509
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,690
Let's see that roll.

510
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,030
Is that all Haskell had?

511
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,980
- Isn't it enough?
- No. I thought he had more.

512
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,280
Not that I know of. You can search me if you think
I'm holding out on you.

513
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,980
Well, maybe I will at that.

514
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,270
He told me he was going to bet $3,000 ...

515
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,100
... on a horse named "Paradisical" on Wednesday
at Santa Anita.

516
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,450
- He was stringing you along. He meant $300.
- Maybe.

517
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,750
Sure, three bucks, three hundred.
He was a piece of cheese a big blowhard.

518
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,700
Listen mister, don't try and tell me anything about
Charlie Haskell.

519
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,640
Remember, I knew him better than you did.

520
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:25,500
OK, then you knew he was a four-flusher.
That explains the three grand bet.

521
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,930
I'm not so sure, he didn't have that three grand.

522
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,510
Why should I believe you?
You've got all the earmarks of a cheap crook.

523
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,010
- Now wait a minute.
- Shut up.

524
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,650
You're a cheap crook and you killed him.

525
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,150
For two cents, I'd change my mind and turn you in.
I don't like you.

526
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,750
- Alright alright, don't get sore.
- I'm not getting sore.

527
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,850
But just remember who's boss around here.

528
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,050
If you shut up and don't give me any arguments
you'll have nothing to worry about.

529
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,330
But if you act wise ...

530
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,530
... I'll make sure you pop into jail so fast,
it'll give you the bends.

531
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,450
- I'm not arguing.
- We see that you don't.

532
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,880
You know, as crooked as you look ...

533
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:57,270
... I hate to see a fella as young as you
wind up sniffing that perfume that ...

534
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,950
... Arizona hands out free to murderers.

535
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,750
- I'm not a murderer.
- Of course, you're not ...

536
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,300
Haskell knocked his own head off.

537
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,870
He fell, that's all, just like I told you.

538
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,010
Sure and then he made you a present of his belongings.

539
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,770
- I explained why I did that.
- Oh, skip it.

540
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,550
It doesn't make a difference one way or another.
I'm not a mourner.

541
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,330
I liked Haskell even less than I like you.

542
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,800
- Yeah, I saw what you did to him.
- What do you mean?

543
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,340
- The scratches on his wrist.
- Sure, I scratched him.

544
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,590
I'll say you did.

545
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,180
So your idea was to drive the car a little way ...

546
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,950
... maybe into San Bernardino and then leave it.
You weren't going to sell it?

547
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,160
Sell it? Do you think I'm crazy? Somebody else's car.

548
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,750
Yeah, all I want is to leave it somewhere
and forget I ever saw it.

549
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,700
Not only don't you have any scruples,
you don't have any brains.

550
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,750
I don't get you.

551
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,300
Maybe, it's a good thing you met me.
You'd have got yourself caught, sure.

552
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,450
Why you dope.

553
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,070
Don't you know that a deserted
automobile always rates an investigation?

554
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,350
Huh?

555
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,220
Look, the cops find a car. Then they get curious.

556
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,050
They wonder where the owner is.

557
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,600
So all right, they don't trace Haskell.
They trace you.

558
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,230
I never thought of that.

559
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,080
The only safe way to get rid of the car
is to sell it to a dealer.

560
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,200
Get it registered under a new name.

561
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,910
Hey, stop at the next store. I want to get
a bottle and do some shopping ...

562
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,500
... before we hit L.A.

563
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,710
OK, if we find a place, I'll drop you off
and pick you up later.

564
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,890
Nothing doing. You're coming in too.

565
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,800
From now on, you and I are like the Siamese twins.

566
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,940
Have it your way, but I don't get the point.

567
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,080
The point is: I don't want you to get lost.

568
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,070
- I'm not going to beat it, if that's what you're afraid of.
- I'll say you're not.

569
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,010
Why I'm going to see you sell this car,
so you don't caught.

570
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,220
Thanks.

571
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,900
Course your interest wouldn't be financial, would it?

572
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,610
You wouldn't want a small percentage of the profits.

573
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,620
Well, now that you insist, how can I refuse.

574
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,340
- A hundred percent will do.
- Fine. I'm relieved.

575
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:40,660
I thought for a moment, you were going to take it all.

576
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,550
I don't want to be a hog.

577
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
A few hours later, we were in Hollywood.

578
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,970
I was recognising places Sue had written about.

579
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:52,030
It struck me that far from being at
the end of the trip ...

580
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,100
... there was a greater distance between Sue and me
than when I started out.

581
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,730
Vera wasn't kidding with that “Siamese twins" crack.

582
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,410
She rented a little apartment ...

583
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,940
... as Mrs Charles Haskell.

584
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,510
When I objected to this, she explained
it was on account of the car.

585
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,680
The dealer might think something was funny,
if he called ...

586
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:14,150
... and found we were using different names.

587
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,400
- Home sweet home.
- Yeah.

588
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,280
Not bad either.

589
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,250
In case there is any doubt in your mind,
I'll take the bedroom.

590
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,520
Yep.

591
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,840
Sure is stuffy in here.

592
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,550
- Keep the windows shut.
- OK.

593
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,700
The old crow downstairs said there's a folding bed
behind this door.

594
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,840
You know how to work it?

595
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,220
I invented it.

596
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,880
- Some joint.
- One can't have everything.

597
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm first in the bathroom.

598
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,730
I don't know why, but I figured you would be.

599
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,670
Boy oh boy! It sure feels good to be clean again.

600
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,380
I must be 10 pounds lighter.

601
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,090
You must be.

602
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,630
Well that's alright. This is exactly the way
you keep your school book induction.

603
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,000
I wish that guy with the sax' would give up.

604
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,210
It gets on my nerves.

605
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,100
Forget it.

606
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,330
Have a drink.

607
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,170
Aren't you afraid I might take you up on it?

608
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,660
I didn't want to give you a drink,
I wouldn't have offered it.

609
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm very sorry, Roberts.
You got yourself into this thing.

610
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,850
You should be grateful, I'm not turning you in.

611
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,000
Why if I wasn't regular, you'd be in the pen this minute
being photographed ...

612
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,150
... finger-printed and being pushed around by the cops.

613
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,350
So cheer up. Get rid of that long puss.

614
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,860
Or is your conscience bothering you?

615
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,450
No.

616
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,150
- It isn't.
- Swell, that's good.

617
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,880
He's dead and no mooning around will bring him back.

618
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,370
Anyway, I never could understand this worrying about
something all been done with.

619
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,470
Now look, Vera, for the last time,
I didn't kill him.

620
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,400
Haskell was sick man. Maybe he was dead
before he fell out of the car. I don't know.

621
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,300
Sure, sure. He died of old age.

622
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,400
Alright ...

623
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,500
... so it'll make you sociable.

624
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,650
You didn't kill him.

625
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,870
Thanks.

626
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,000
- We're out of liquor, Roberts.
- Yeah.

627
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,150
Too bad, I felt like getting tight tonight.

628
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,860
- Well, I think you succeeded.
- Am I tight?

629
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,460
As a prima donna's corset.

630
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,780
That's good. I wanted to get tight.

631
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,470
Why? What have got to get tight about.

632
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,230
Oh, I don't know, a few things.

633
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,000
You should have my worries.

634
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,400
If I had your troubles, I'd stay sober.

635
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,320
And I've got the key to that door!

636
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,550
Yep.

637
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,350
- Maybe you're right.
- I'm always right.

638
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,150
You know, I don't like your attitude, Roberts.

639
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,100
Well, there's a lot of things I don't like.

640
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,590
Sure is.

641
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,030
Life's like a ball game, you got to take
a swing at whatever comes along ...

642
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,130
... before you wake up and find it's the ninth innings.

643
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,500
- You read that somewhere.
- That's the problem with you, Roberts.

644
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,800
All you do is bellyache

645
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:30,130
I'm taking it easy, and trying to make
the best of things.

646
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,580
Maybe that's what wrong with the whole world.

647
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,240
It's a profession.

648
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,890
People knock themselves out trying to bust fate.

649
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,130
Now take you, for instance.
You're lucky to be alive.

650
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,410
Why, supposing Haskell had opened your door.

651
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,780
You'd be playing a harp, now.
Think of that.

652
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,240
You think of it. I'm tired of thinking.

653
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:53,230
There's plenty of people dying this minute ...

654
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,700
... would give anything to trade places with you.

655
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,360
I know what I'm talking about.

656
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,830
I'm not so sure.

657
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,130
At least, they know they're done for.

658
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,000
They don't have to sweat blood wondering if they are.

659
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,440
Your philosophy stinks, pal.

660
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:13,700
We all know we're going to kick off some day.

661
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,350
It's only a question of when.

662
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,600
What got us on this subject anyway?
We'll be discussing politics, next.

663
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,930
Yeah.

664
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,550
Where'd you hide the butts?

665
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,760
On the table, sucker.

666
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,550
We are bored each other with conversation
for a couple of hours longer.

667
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,350
Every five minutes, one of us was wishing
we had another bottle ...

668
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,830
... or a radio, or something to read.

669
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,650
Then finally, we ended ran out of chatter.

670
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,690
I know it's only eleven o'clock,
but I want to get up early ...

671
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,350
... and make the rounds of the used car lots.

672
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,380
Don't worry about that
we got all the time in the world.

673
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,670
Maybe you have, but if you think I want ...

674
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,270
... to stay cooped up in this place any longer
than I have to, you're batty.

675
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,640
It's not a bad place.

676
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,630
You pay plenty for digs like this in New York.

677
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,830
I wouldn't like it, if it was the Ritz.

678
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,450
Rotten liquor.

679
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,180
You got a mean cough. You want to do
something about it.

680
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,540
I'll be alright.

681
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,750
That's what Camille said.

682
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,120
- Who?
- Nobody you know.

683
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,930
- Wasn't that the dame that died of consumption
- Yes.

684
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,680
Wouldn't it be a break for you, if I did kick off.

685
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,680
You'd be free with old Haskell's stolen car.

686
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,500
I don't want to see anybody die.

687
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:38,310
Not even me?

688
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,400
Specially, not you. One person died on me.

689
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,430
If you did. Well, that's all I need.

690
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,200
You don't like me, do you Roberts?

691
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,800
Like you? I love you.

692
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,270
My favourite sport is being kept prisoner.

693
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,600
After we sell the car, you can go to blazes
for all I care.

694
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,100
But not until then.

695
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,790
I'm going to bed.

696
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,070
Goodnight, Roberts.
Don't try and sneak away during the night.

697
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,480
All doors are locked.

698
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,570
Anyway, I find you gone in the morning ...

699
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,000
... I'll notify the police.

700
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,900
- They'll pick you up.
- Don't worry, I know when I'm in a spot.

701
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,910
Well, good night.

702
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,870
I hope that that portable rack
isn't too uncomfortable for you.

703
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,070
Don't lose any sleep over it, will you Vera?

704
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:25,800
Crest View 6-5-7-2-3

705
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,500
Hello? Hello?

706
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,120
Hello? Hello?

707
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:45,560
No. Not yet, darling.

708
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,000
Tomorrow ... maybe.

709
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,100
If this were fiction, I would fall in love with Vera.

710
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:58,280
Marry her and make a respectable woman of her.

711
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,710
Or else, she would make some supreme, Class A
sacrifice for me ...

712
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,850
... and die.

713
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,110
Sue and I would bawl a little over her grave ...

714
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,130
... and make some crack about there's good
in all of us.

715
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,850
But Vera, unfortunately, was just as rotten in the morning ...

716
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,220
... as she'd been the night before.

717
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,210
Alright alright, I'm coming.

718
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,390
Look Vera, it's almost noon.

719
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,860
So what? The dealers will be there all day.

720
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:26,170
They'll be there all year too,
but we don't have to wait that long.

721
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,310
Shut up. You're making like a husband.

722
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,700
- Well, do I rate a whistle?
- You sure do, but let's go.

723
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,300
Let's go, let's go. I spend $85 and two hours
preparing bait ...

724
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:41,750
... and all you can say is, "Let's go”.

725
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,240
Come on.

726
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,620
We passed a few used car lots last night down this way.

727
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,250
What do you think we can get for this heap?

728
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,890
I don't know. Plenty. Just let me handle everything.

729
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,590
Think you can get two thousand dollars?

730
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,020
I don't know. But don't worry ...

731
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:01,460
I'll squeeze as much out of this guy, as I can.

732
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,720
If I let it go cheap without a fight,
he might think we've stolen the car.

733
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,100
And listen, don't make any slips and call me Roberts.
That'll cook us.

734
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:11,020
I don't need you to tell me that.

735
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,440
You better just sit by and keep your mouth closed.

736
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,510
Remember we're both in the soup,
if anything happens ...

737
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,560
- Forget it and drive.
- You're my wife, Vera Haskell.

738
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,670
Look, after the deal's closed ...

739
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,650
... let's go back to that place
on Hollywood Boulevard ...

740
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,370
... where I saw the fur jacket.
I want to buy it.

741
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,270
After the deal's closed, I'm saying goodbye to you.

742
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:34,020
That's right, I forgot.
I guess I'm getting kind of used to you.

743
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:36,180
Well that's a habit you can start breaking.

744
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,000
Let's try this place in the middle of the block.

745
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,650
Good afternoon, what can I do for you?

746
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:52,000
- We're interested in selling a car.
- If the price is right.

747
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:57,630
Well, if it's in good mechanical condition,
it should bluebook for about $1600.

748
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,230
Tony, take a look at this motor.

749
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,700
Sixteen hundred, are you kidding?

750
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,600
Well, maybe $1850.

751
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:20,780
Before I let it go for $1850, I'll wreck it
and collect the insurance first.

752
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:26,730
Lady, this motor's seen a lot of driving.

753
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,850
While the mechanic inspected the car we haggled.

754
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,230
At last, when we were all worn out
we hit a compromise ...

755
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,110
... his price.

756
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,620
- OK, it's a deal.
- Right, come in and we'll sign the papers.

757
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,770
I have the ownership papers right here with me.

758
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,340
Look Vera, in the meantime, will you clean out
the ash compartment.

759
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:55,250
- Maybe there's some stuff in it.
- Alright, darling.

760
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,350
1850 bucks, that dirty crook.

761
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,540
- Hmm, New York, huh?
- Yup.

762
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,970
- But you bought the car in Miami.
- Yes.

763
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,630
Well, let's see about the insurance, we can either
have it transferred or cancelled.

764
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,420
Ah, what kind of insurance do you have, Mr. Haskell?

765
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,200
Well ah ...

766
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,890
... aren't all the papers there?

767
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,140
I don't see any.

768
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,950
Surely you know what type of insurance
you carry on the car.

769
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,220
The name of the company?

770
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah, but ...

771
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,320
Well, if you'll just tell me the name of the company ...

772
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:37,380
- ... I'd be very glad to take care of all the details.
- Well ...

773
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,490
- Did you sign the papers yet?
- Not yet.

774
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,690
Well don't. We're not selling the car.

775
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,610
- Well, wait a minute, Mrs Haskell.
- Come on darling.

776
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,010
- What's the matter? Change your mind?
- Yes, I'm sorry, I guess I have.

777
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,200
- But, Vera ...
- Let's go.

778
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,770
You got me out of a tight spot Vera,
but I still don't understand all this.

779
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:00,830
You will in a minute.
I almost threw away a gold mine.

780
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,860
$1850 isn't to be sneezed at.

781
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,840
The car doesn't book for as much as I thought.

782
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,610
- We're not selling the car.
- You want to keep it?

783
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,170
Now wait a minute, Vera, you said yourself
I wouldn't be safe ...

784
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,770
... until the car was in someone else's name.

785
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,540
I'd like to be free of this mess, when I go.

786
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:17,140
That's just it, Robert, you're not going.

787
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,760
There's a drive in at the corner.
Pull in there and we'll get a bite to eat ...

788
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:21,300
... and, I'll explain.

789
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,000
What is this - another one of your brilliant ideas?

790
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:32,640
- Hello, may I take your order?
- Make mine, a ham sandwich and coffee.

791
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:37,500
- And for you sir?
- Oh, I don't care ... the same.

792
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,100
Thank you.

793
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:46,390
Get this, Vera.
I've been pretty patient, so far.

794
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,220
- I've done everything you asked me to do, but no more.
- Shut up!

795
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,730
We've taken Haskell's money ...

796
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,660
You can have the dough we get from
selling the car ...

797
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,170
... but you're not going to keep me a prisoner.

798
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,160
It's a good thing I bought the paper.
Take a look at that.

799
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,300
- Vera, I'm in no mood ...
- Read that!

800
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,350
- No.
- Yes.

801
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,050
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

802
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,110
You think I'm crazy? It's impossible I tell you.

803
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,710
Excuse me.

804
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:25,540
Blow the horn when you're through.

805
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,700
No one could possibly get away with an act like that.
They'd be wise to me in a minute

806
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,910
Don't be yellow.
You look enough like him.

807
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,310
The same colouring and the same build.
See how his clothes fit?

808
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,340
I'm not kidding. You almost had me fooled for a while.

809
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,470
Oh, grow up, Vera.
Don't you think a father knows his own son?

810
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,520
And there must be other relatives.

811
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,310
The father won't have to know you.
We'll wait till he gives up the ghost.

812
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,430
He's an old geezer and he won't pull through.

813
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,390
And as far as the relatives are concerned ...

814
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,250
They haven't seen you in fifteen or twenty years.

815
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,160
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry ...

816
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,650
And I won't do it.

817
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,810
It's not as tough as it sounds.
Remember, you've...

818
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,170
... got all kinds of identification: his car,
letters, license ...

819
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,040
I could never get away with it.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

820
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:05,940
The old boy has bags of dough.
Look in the paper there ...

821
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,260
Personal fortune assessed over fifteen million.

822
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,990
He'll leave plenty, I tell you.

823
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,070
Maybe he cut off his son. How do we know?

824
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,700
It's out, Vera. I won't have anything to do with it.

825
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,980
I think you will.

826
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,660
Look Vera, I'll do anything within reason.

827
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,720
But not that. So forget it.
Find yourself another stooge.

828
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,580
You're sick.

829
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,870
You'd be fixed for the rest of your life as Charlie Haskell.

830
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,830
You can take your inheritance and go away.

831
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,650
No more worrying about the rent, no sweating ...

832
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,420
... scheming, wondering where your next meal's
coming from. Think about that, Roberts.

833
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,630
Vera, please. You're talking too loud.

834
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,270
Unless I'm splitting 50-50 with you? Sure. Why not?

835
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,550
- We're both alike, both born the same guy.
- Take it easy, Vera.

836
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,610
People around here are going to hear you talk.

837
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,160
We'll wait until we read old man Haskell's dead.

838
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,600
Then you show up.

839
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,980
Like you read in New York that he was sick.

840
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,480
No.

841
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:59,100
- Suppose he doesn't die?
- He will, I know he will. Something tells me.

842
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,310
But as much as I insisted, I would have no part
of her scheme.

843
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,310
Vera was taking it for granted, I would.

844
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,880
Neither of us had our minds on the cards
as we played that night.

845
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,940
I knew we were just trying to kill time
between newspaper editions.

846
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:17,910
This was a death watch, for Vera.

847
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,810
Maybe it was for me too.

848
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:23,210
Don't you realise, if I'm caught, they'll want to know
where I got the car and stuff.

849
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,640
- And they'll have me on a murder charge.
- If you're smart, you won't get caught.

850
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:27,850
I'm out for seven.

851
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,860
If I'm caught, don't you realise you'll be out too?

852
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:34,450
18 points. That gives me 30.

853
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:38,960
How will I be out?
You'll be out $1850, you would have gotten on the car.

854
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,520
Really Vera, you'll be an awful chump.
You threw away all that dough on a dizzy long shot.

855
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,750
Let me sell the bus tomorrow. With the money
it'll bring and...

856
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,380
... what you've already got a clever kid like you
could run it up in no time.

857
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:50,030
- And we'd both be in the clear.
- I'll be in the clear anyway.

858
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:54,060
Maybe. Maybe.
But if I got caught ...

859
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,190
- I'd get good and sore too, you know.
- You mean you'd squeal?

860
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,970
- Well no, not squeal exactly
- Never mind what you meant.

861
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,290
Even if you did tell the cops, I was in on it
with you ...

862
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,170
... what could they do to me?

863
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,660
They might give me the same medicine they gave you.

864
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,590
- Yeah.
- A rope.

865
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:16,220
But I'm on my way now.

866
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,060
All they'd be doing would be rushing it.

867
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,630
Alright, but think of the $1850 you'd lose

868
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,020
You'd kick yourself around the block,
if you let it get away from you.

869
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,200
I'll take the chance.

870
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,430
- Want another drink?
- You being a goon.

871
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,400
That's the way people wind up behind the eight ball ...

872
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,870
Once they get a few dollars, they become greedy
and want more.

873
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,980
- More. More.
- Caesar.

874
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,870
- Who?
- You know, that Roman general.

875
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,150
He got his, for being greedy.

876
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,450
He wasn't satisfied, so the final wind up was
he took the count.

877
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,760
A couple of days ago, you didn't have a dime.

878
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,720
Why you were so broke, you couldn't pay
cash for a postage stamp.

879
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,890
Now you've got almost $700, with $1850 in the offing.

880
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,020
- Take my advice, don't try for more!
- I'm tired of this game.

881
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,180
- Let's have some black jack.
- Play solitaire!

882
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,710
OK I will, if that's the way you feel about it.

883
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,890
That's the way I feel about it.

884
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,050
Getting sore and throwing things won't help much, Roberts.

885
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,640
I'm really doing you a favour.
I help you out of a jam by keeping my mouth shut.

886
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,660
I show you how to make some soft money,
and what thanks do I get.

887
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,800
- Thanks?!
- Sure, or would you rather I called the cops ...

888
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,080
... and tell them you killed the man
and stole his money.

889
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,200
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Yes, you did.

890
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,720
No, I didn't. You know I didn't.

891
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,540
Alright, then.

892
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:18,810
Suppose I call the cops ...

893
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,510
If you're innocent, what have you got to be scared of?

894
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,100
OK, call them, if you must.
Go ahead, call them. See if I care.

895
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,120
At least they'll give me a square deal.

896
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,280
- You want me to call them?
- You heard me. But I'm warning you ...

897
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,300
If I'm pinched, I'll swear you were in on it.
I'll say that you helped me.

898
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:37,260
- If I fry, I'll get even with you.
- You wouldn't dare, you're chicken!

899
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,620
Yeah? Then try it and see.
Call them. Yeah.

900
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,810
Okay I will.

901
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,720
Information?

902
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:03,210
I want the number of the Hollywood police station.

903
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,420
OK, I got it. Thanks.

904
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,560
Wait a minute, Vera, you wouldn't do that.

905
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,240
Oh, wouldn't I? Let me do it, and I'll show you
if I would.

906
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:13,330
Take it easy. Now let's talk this over.

907
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,040
This was early in the evening.

908
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,730
And the conversation while hectic was at least pitched low.

909
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:21,490
But as the minutes passed ...

910
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:24,370
... and more obstacles to her plan
popped into in my head ...

911
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,070
... the air got blue.

912
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,360
Each word coming from our lips cracked like a whip.

913
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:33,380
I reminded her that as Charles Haskell,
I didn't even know my mother's name ...

914
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:36,950
... where I'd gone to school,
the name of my best friend ...

915
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,250
... whether I had an Aunt Emma or not,
my religion ...

916
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,300
... and if I'd ever owned a dog.

917
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:45,060
I didn't even know what my middle initial stood for.

918
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:49,090
I also pointed out that the real Haskell
had a scar on his forearm.

919
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,880
His people never saw that scar.

920
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,270
You told me he ran away right after putting out
the kid's eye.

921
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,620
Yeah, but his father knew he was cut.

922
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:57,960
- There'd be some kind of a mark.
- So what?

923
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,980
The old man's dead or will be, I hope,
by tomorrow morning's papers.

924
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:06,470
Anyway, you could cut yourself a little, couldn't you?

925
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,850
Boy, for that kind of dough, I'd let you
cut my leg off.

926
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,590
You're drunk and you're crazy mad, Vera.

927
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,620
Turn me in, if you want to,
but I won't get mixed up in this.

928
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,690
Besides, how do we know? Haskell was such a phony.

929
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,710
Maybe he wasn't the man's son after all.
Maybe he just dreamed it up.

930
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,670
Well, dreaming or not ...

931
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,540
... you won't be dreaming
when the law taps you on the shoulder.

932
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:27,140
There's a cute little gas chamber
waiting for you, Roberts.

933
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:30,710
And I hear extradition to Arizona's a cinch.

934
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,820
Where's that phone?

935
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,100
- Vera!
- Leave me alone.

936
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:38,190
- Vera!
- I want a phone call, police.

937
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:42,440
I hate you, you stinking ...
You leave me alone!

938
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,680
I'll let you alone when you promise
to leave the phone where it is.

939
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,830
You're drunk. You don't know what you're doing

940
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,360
- You're hurting me,
- Will you promise?

941
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,850
Alright.

942
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,850
You hurt me.

943
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,020
- I'm sorry, but ...
- It's hot in here, open up the window!

944
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:05,540
- It's not hot.
- Don't tell me. Now do you do it or do I do it?

945
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:08,740
- You're no gentleman, see?
- Yeah.

946
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:12,610
Alright, I'll open up the window.

947
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,290
Vera!

948
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:22,250
Vera, open the door. Please open the door.

949
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,800
Vera, open the door. Don't use the phone.
Listen to me.

950
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,790
I don't like you, Roberts.

951
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:30,510
You're no gentleman, see. You hurt my hand.

952
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,000
And I'm going to get even with you.

953
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,980
You don't open the door, I'm going to kick it down, Vera.

954
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:39,700
Vera, don't call the cops. Listen to me.
I'll do anything you say.

955
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,630
Vera, let me in.

956
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,910
I'll break the phone!

957
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,300
Vera ...

958
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,880
The world is full of sceptics.

959
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,130
I know - I'm one myself.

960
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:31,250
In the Haskell business, how many of you would believe
he fell out of the car?

961
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,770
And now, after killing Vera without
really meaning to do it.

962
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,210
How many of you would believe it wasn't premeditated.

963
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:40,970
In a jury room, every last man of you would go down
shouting that ...

964
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:45,600
... she had me over a barrel and my only out was force.

965
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:48,310
The room was still.

966
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,990
So quiet that for a while I wondered
if I had suddenly gone deaf.

967
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,830
It was pure fear of course.
And I was hysterical.

968
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,880
But without making a sound.

969
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:02,800
Vera was dead
and I was her murderer.

970
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:06,120
Murderer!
What an awful word that is.

971
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:09,710
But I had become one.
I'd better not get caught.

972
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,230
What evidence there was around the place
had to be destroyed.

973
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,370
And from the looks of things, there was plenty.

974
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,880
Looking around the room, at the things we'd bought ...

975
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:20,340
... was like looking into the faces of a hundred
people, who had seen us together and who remembered me.

976
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:24,290
This was the kind of testimony, I couldn't rub out.

977
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,320
No. I could burn clothes and hide bottles ...

978
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:30,440
... for the next five years.
There'd always be witnesses.

979
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:32,260
The landlady for one. She could identify me.

980
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,600
The car dealer, the waitress in the drive-in,
the girl in the dress shop and ...

981
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,450
... the guy in the liquor store.

982
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,520
They could all identify me.

983
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:44,320
I was cooked. Done for. I had to get out of there.

984
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,890
While once I had remained beside a dead body ...

985
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:50,090
... planning carefully how to avoid being
accused of killing him ...

986
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,240
... this time I couldn't.

987
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,990
This time I was guilty.

988
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,610
I knew it.

989
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,480
Felt it.

990
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,710
I was like a guy suffering from shock.

991
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,450
Things were whirling around in my head.

992
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,380
I couldn't make myself think right.

993
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,760
All I could think of was the guy with the saxophone
and what he was playing.

994
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:12,300
It wasn't a love song.

995
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:15,500
It was a dirge.

996
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,200
But my problems weren't solved.

997
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:07,800
I had to stay away from New York for all time.

998
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:11,800
Because Al Roberts was listed as dead,
and had to stay dead.

999
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:14,310
And I could never to go back to Hollywood.

1000
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,790
Someone might recognize me as Haskell ...

1001
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,380
Then too, there was Sue ...

1002
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:26,540
I could never go to her with a thing like this
hanging over my head.

1003
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:30,790
All I could do was pray she'd be happy.

1004
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,160
I was in Bakersfield, before I read that Vera's body
was discovered ...

1005
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:50,380
... and that the police were looking for Haskell
in connection with his wife's murder.

1006
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:52,460
Isn't that a laugh?

1007
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:56,500
Haskell got me into this mess, and
Haskell was getting me out of it.

1008
01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,810
The police were searching for a dead man.

1009
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,430
I keep trying to forget what happened ...

1010
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:12,060
... and wonder what my life might have been, if that
car of Haskell's hadn't stopped.

1011
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:15,440
But one thing, I don't have to wonder about.

1012
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,040
I know ...

1013
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:23,860
... someday a car will stop to pick me up
that I never thumbed.

1014
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:31,810
Yes. Fate ... or some mysterious force ...

1015
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,980
... can put the finger on you or me ...

1016
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:38,050
... for no good reason at all.
