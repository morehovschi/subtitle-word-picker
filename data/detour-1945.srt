the only way i could
cross country was

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,976
to thumb rides

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,976
or even after hawking
everything i only

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,680
had enough money to eat

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,800
money you know what that is

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,976
it's the stuff you
never have enough of

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,976
little green things with george

it's the stuff that
has caused more

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,976
trouble in the world
than anything else

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
we ever invented

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,533
simply because
there's too little of it

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,976
at least i had too little of it

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,733
so it was me for the thumb

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,533
ever done any
hitchhiking it's not much

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
fun believe me

people and all that

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,067

save your bus fare but

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,120

what's in store for you

book of rules for

to talk

i drove all that
night while haskell

408
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,280
slept like a log

409
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,976
after a while i
began to get sleepy

410
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
myself

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,533
i was happy though
soon i'd be with sue

again

the long trip was
practically over and

414
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,976
it'd be no more
hoofing it down the

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,333
i began to think
of the future which

417
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,976
couldn't have
been brighter if i'd

418
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,976
embroidered it with neon lights

419
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,976
it was nice to think
of sue shooting to

until then i had done
things my way but

435
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,976
from then on something
else stepped in

436
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,976
and shunned me
off to a different

437

one i had picked for

440
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,333
mr haskell what's
the matter are you

441

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,976
gonna hand me even
before you open your

mouth you're gonna
tell me you don't

446
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,976
believe my story of
how heskel died and

447
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,976
give me that don't make me laugh

[Music]

450
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,976
i saw it once he was
dead and i was in

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,976
for it

452
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,976
who would believe
he fell out of the car

453
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,976
why pasco came to
which of course he

454
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,976
couldn't even he was
where i calmed him

455
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,976
over the head for his dog

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,533
yes i was in for it
instinct told me to

457
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,001
run

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,976
but then i realized
it was hopeless

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,976
there were lots of
people back down the

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,976
road who could
identify me that gas

461
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,733
station guy and the weight

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,976
piece that would be
the worst spot then

463
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,976
trying to explain why i beat it

464
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,976
the next possibility
was to sit tight

465
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,976
and tell the truth
when the cops came

466
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,680
but that would be crazy

467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,976
they'd laugh at the
truth i'm not having

468
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,976
my head in the news

[Music]

470
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,976
so what else was
it to do but hide the

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,976
body and get away
in the car i couldn't

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,976
leave the car
there with him in the

473
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,976
gully

474
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,533
that would be like
erecting a tombstone

[Music]

476
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,976
my idea was to cover
him with brush not

477
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,976
to rob him

478
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,976
but then i remember
that even if i only

479
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,976
drove the car for
100 miles or so i

480
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,680
would need money for gas

481
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,976
besides it was
stupid for me to leave

482
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,867
all that money on a dead man

483
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,976
not only that i'd
have to take his

484
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,976
driver's license in
case i was stopped

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
for something

486
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,976
i didn't like to
think about it but by

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,976
that time i'd done
just what the police

488

there was no time

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,976
had to be charles
haskell was dangerous

565
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,976
and i'd have to be
charles haskell until

566
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,976
i got to some city
where i could leave

567
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
the car and be swallowed up

[Music]

569
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,976
that meant driving
the car as far as san

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,333
bernardino maybe
even to los angeles

571
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,976
in a little town i
might be noticed but

572
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,133
in a city i should
be safe enough

573
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,976
then after i ditched
the car i could go

574
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
on to sue

575
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,976
but those five
minutes at the state line

576
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,976
made me realize it
might be a good idea

577
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,976
to find out a
little bit about mr

578
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
haskell

579
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,976
then if anybody
asked me questions i

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,867
could give the right answers

581
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,976
the first thing i
found out was that i

582
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
had 768

583
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
this was a lot of
jack but believe me

584
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,976
was the kind of
money i'd rather not

585
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,976
have

586
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
[Music]

587
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,976
and then i found
out from a letter

588
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,400
haskell was cutting
around in his bag

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,976
that he wasn't the open-handed

590
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,976
easy-going big shot
who went around

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,976
buying dinners for
strange hitchhikers

592
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,976
before i got done
reading it i saw him

593
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
more as a chisler

594
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,976
it was written to his old man in

595
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,976
california the one
he hadn't seen in so

596
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
many years

597
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,267
in it has composed
as a salesman of

hymnals

599
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,467
of all things it was
easy to see where

600
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,976
haskell expected
to raise a new stake

601
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,680
for his book in miami

602
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
by looking as old man

603
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,976
that was about all
i found out from his

effects

605
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,067
and it was enough i told myself

606
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,976
maybe old man haskell
was lucky his son

607
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
kicked off

608
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,533
he would never know
it but it saved him

609
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,600
from taking a flier
in sacred literature

653
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,976
when she looked at me

654
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,976
which i put down
it's just my jangled

655
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,976
nerves

656
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,976
with her eyes closed
and the test has

657
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,976
gone out of them

658
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,467
she seemed homeless
enough and instead

659
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,976
of disliking her i

660
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,600
began to feel sorry
for her the poor kid

661
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,267
probably had had
a rough time of it

662
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,976
who was she anyway
and why was she going

663
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,120
to los angeles

664
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,976
and where'd she
come from in the first

665
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,600
place the only thing
i knew about it was

666
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,976
her name

667
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,976
not that it made
any difference a few

668
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,976
hours more would be in hollywood

669
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,976
i'd forget where i
parked the car and

670
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
look up sue

671
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,976
this nightmare of
being a dead man would

672
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
be over

673

haskell all the
way from louisiana

687
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,400

outside of shreveport

you rode you heard me

689
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,976

back to me all the talk

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
about dueling and
scars and scratches

691
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,533
there was no doubt
about it must be the

692
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
woman haskell had mentioned

693
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,976

passed me while i slept

in any arizona gully

right there in the car

laughing like mad
while he haunted me

you're a cheap crook
and you killed him

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,976
for two cents i'd
change my mind and

761

if you shut up and
don't give me any

have nothing to worry

about

768
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,976
but if you act wise
well mister you'll

769
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,976
pop into jail so
fast it'll give you the

770
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,001
bins

771
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,533
i'm not arguing that
you don't you know

772
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,976
as quick as you look

773
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,976
i'd hate to see a
fella as young as you

774
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,976
wind up sniffing
that perfume that

arizona hands are
free to murderers i'm

776
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,976
not a murderer

777
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,976
of course you're not
asking knocked his

778
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,976
own head off if so
that's how happened

779
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,976
just like i told you
yeah and then he

780
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,976
made you a president
of his belongings

781
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,976
i explained why i
would do that doesn't

782
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,976
make a difference
one way or another

783
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,333
i'm not a mourner
i like tascor even

784
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,976
less than i like you

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,976
yeah i saw what you
did to him what do

786
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,976
you mean scratches on his wrist

787
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,400
sure i scratched
him i'll say you did

788
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,976
so your idea was
to drive the car a

789
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,976
little way maybe
into san bernardino

790
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,976
then

791
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,976
you weren't gonna
sell it sell it you

792
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,976
think i'm crazy
somebody else's car

793
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,976
see all i want to do is leave it

794
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,976
somewhere and forget
i have a sauce not

795
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,976
only don't you have
any scruple you

796
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,976
don't have any brains

797
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,976
i don't get you
maybe it's a good thing

798
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,976
you met me you'd
have got yourself

799
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,001
caught sure

800
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,976
why you dope don't you know what

801
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,976
deserted automobile
always rates an

802
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,976
investigation

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,467
huh look the cops
find a car then they

804
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,976
get curious

805
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
they wonder where
the owner is so all

806
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,976
right they don't trace haskell

807
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,467
they trace you i
never thought of that

808
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,976
the only safe way
to get rid of the car

809
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,976
is to sell it to a dealer get it

810
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
registered under a new name

811
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,976
say stop at the next

want you to get

821
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,001
lost

822

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,976

thanks of course
your interest wouldn't

827
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,360
be financial work

828
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,976
you wouldn't want a
small percentage of

829
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,600
the profits well now
that you insist how

830
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
can i refuse

831
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,976
a hundred percent
will do fine i'm

832
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,976
relieved i thought
for a moment you're

833
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
going to take it all

834
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,976
i don't want to be
a hog a few hours

835
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,733
later we were in hollywood

836
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,976
i was recognizing
places sue had written

837
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,976
about it struck me
that far from being

838
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,680
at the end of the trip

839
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,976
there was a greater
distance between sue

840
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,976
and me than when i started out

841
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,976
pirro wasn't kidding
with that siamese

charles haskell

845
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,976
when i objected to
this she explained

846
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,976
that it was an
account of the car

847
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,976
the dealer might
think something was

848
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,976
funny if he called
and finally were

849
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,680
using different names

850

00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,976
son and there must
be other relatives

the father won't
have to know you but

whaley gives it the
ghost he's an old

geezer and he won't pull through

1166
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,976
and as far as
other relatives are

1167
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,976
concerned they
haven't seen you in 15 or

it sounds remember

1171
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,976

alike both more in

1197
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,001
the same gutter

1198
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,976
take it easy vera
there's people around

1199
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,533

what you're talking

1200
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,976
well where do we
read that old man has

1201
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,680
goes dead and you show up

1202
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,976
like you read in
new york that he was

1203
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
sick no

1204
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,976

die he will i know he

1205
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,680
will something tells me

1206
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,976
but as much as i
insisted i would have

1207
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,976
no part of her scheme
her was taking it

1208
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,520
for granted i would

1209
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,976
neither of us had
our mind on the cards

1210
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,680
as we played that night

1211
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,976
i knew we were
just trying to kill time

1212
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,733
between newspaper editions

1213
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,600
this was a death
watch for vera maybe it

1214
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,120
was for me too

1215
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,976
don't you realize
if i'm caught i want

1216
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,976
to know where i
got the car and stuff

1217
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,976
and they'll have me
on a murder charge

1218
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,067
yeah smart you won't get caught

1219
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,976
why not for sale
and if i'm caught don't

1220
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,800
you realize you'll be up to

1221
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,680
18 points it gives me 30.

1222
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,467
how will i be out
you'll be out 850 we

1223
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,976
would have gotten on the car

1224
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,976
really very awful
chunky through we all

1225
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,976
let doe on a dizzy long shot

1226
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,976
let me sell a bus
tomorrow with the

1227
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,976
money it'll bring
and what you've

1228
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:19,976
already got a clever
kid like you can

1229
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,976
run it up in no time

1230
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,976
then we'd both be
in the clear i'll be

1231
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,680
in the clear anyway maybe

1232
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,680
maybe but if i got caught

1233
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,976
i'd get couldn't swatch
you you know you

1234
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,976
mean you'd squeal
well no not squealing

1235
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,400
never mind what
you meant even if you

1236
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,976
did tell the cops i
was in honor with

1237
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,976
you

1238
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,600
what could they do
to me they might give

1239
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,976
me the same
medicine they gave you

1240
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
yeah a rope

1241
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,680
but i'm on my way anyhow

1242
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,976
all they'll be doing
will be rushing it

1243
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,976
all right

1244
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,976
but like the 1850
you'd lose you'd kick

1245
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,976
yourself along the
block if you ever get

1246
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,976
away from you

1247
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,533
i'll take the chance
want another drink

1248
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,520
you're being a goon

1249
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,976
that's the way people
wind up behind the

1250
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,976
eight ball once they
get a few dollars

1251
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,976
to become greedy and want more

1252
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,333
my my caesar huh
you know that roman

1253
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,001
general

1254
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,976
he got his for being
greedy he wasn't

1255
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,976
satisfied so the
final wind-up was he

1256
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,120
took the count

1257
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,976
a couple of days
ago you didn't have a

1258

couldn't pay cash
for a postage stamp

1260
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,533
now you've got almost
700 with 18.50 in

1261
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,976

00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,976
this was early in
the evening and the

1297
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,680
conversation while hectic

1298
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,976
was at least pitched
low but as the

1299
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,120
minutes passed

1300
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,976
and more obstacles
to her plan popped

1301
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,933
into my head the air got blue

1302
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,976
each word coming
from our lips cracked

1303
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
like a whip

1304
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,976
i reminded her that
as charles haskell i

1305
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,976
didn't even know
my mother's name

1306
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,976
where i'd gone to
school the name of my

1307
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,976
best friend

1308
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,333
whether i had an
aunt emma or not my

1309
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,976
religion

1310
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,976
and if i had ever
owned a dog i didn't

1311
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,976
even know what my
middle initial stood

1312
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:20,976
for

1313
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,976
i also pointed out
that the real haskell

1314
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,680
had a scar on his forearm

1315
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,976
his people never
saw that scar he told

1316
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,976
me he ran away
right after putting out

1317
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,001
the kid's eye

1318
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,976
yeah but his father
knew he was cut

1319
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,333
it'll be some kind
of a mark so what
