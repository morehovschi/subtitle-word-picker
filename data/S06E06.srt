00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,620
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,283
are your own responsibility.

3
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:05,243
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

4
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:06,643
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

5
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,323
I'm very much looking forward to
working with you again, Michael.

6
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:12,323
That, my friend, is the finest opium
in the world.

7
00:00:12,347 --> 00:00:14,963
- Why would you sell?
- The Irish are being difficult.

8
00:00:14,987 --> 00:00:16,323
The Italians are not an option.

9
00:00:16,347 --> 00:00:19,965
- You're going to America?
- To Canada, to collect payment for the shipment.

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,366
Elizabeth, you are a very lucky woman,

11
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,526
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,046
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,206
She's gone, Tommy. She's gone.

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,446
A daughter lost. A son found.

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,486
This is my son. They call him Duke.

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,246
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,166
- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

18
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,766
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby,

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,686
and you are going
to give us his brother.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,115
What are Michael's real intentions
towards me, Gina?

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,810
And if you lie, I will know.

22
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:50,461
It is my intention to kill Tommy Shelby.

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,777
It was the ambitions and strategies
of one man that caused this.

24
00:01:21,323 --> 00:01:24,083
I will take revenge on Tommy Shelby.

25
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,270
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

26
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:01,486
I want to see my wife first.

27
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,166
After you've fucked your wife,

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,710
you're going to kill a man, right?

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,629

30
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:53,545
The smoke from your daughter's funeral

31
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,920
is still in your clothes...

32
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,110
...and you slept with someone.

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,660
Not just someone.

34
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,923
The enemy.

35
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,060
Every enemy we ever had in one woman.

36
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,926
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I...

37
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,940
You're not so good
at lying any more, Tommy.

38
00:03:18,982 --> 00:03:22,062
These days, the truth gets in your eyes.

39
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,990
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

40
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:31,980
- I need to know where you will go.
- See? You just accept it.

41
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,010
You don't fight it.

42
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,190
You ARE cursed, Tommy.

43
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:45,780
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

44
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:51,620
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

45
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,460
A curse never to be lifted.

46
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,310
I will be away, Lizzie.

47
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,060
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where...

48
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,580
Always gone, always away.

49
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,740
Well, now your rings are gone,

50
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,820
your rings are away.

51
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,430
I'm already packed.

52
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:22,780
Now leave me to say goodbye to Ruby.

53
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:39,196
I have to go away for a bit, Charlie.

54
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,700
Look at me.

55
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,703
Hey. Look at me.

56
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,060
Mum already told me she's leaving...

57
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,100
...and she told me why.

58
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,110
Mum, where are you going?

59
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:18,092
A hotel.

60
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,190
And then your father
will get me a house.

61
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,510
Mum, I'll come with you.

62
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,953
I'd rather be with you.

63
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:34,218
Wherever it is.

64
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,109
You're not my mum...

65
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,117
...but you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

66
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,420
He's never here.

67
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:49,239
I'd be on my own here.

68
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,070
Oh, Charles, love...

69
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,540
...I don't think your father
would allow that.

70
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,540
You can go.

71
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,260
You can go, son.

72
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:06,172
I know a good place.

73
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,020
Lizzie, I'll arrange that place.

74
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,643
And, Charlie, you can take him, eh?

75
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,159
They have stables at this new place.

76
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,340
After a while, he'll...
He'll listen to you.

77
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:20,220
He'll forget about Ruby.

78
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,030
That's how horses are.

79
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,660
And you'll be here all alone.

80
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,726
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

81
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,566
This place I've bought

82
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,135
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there.

83
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,310
Dad...

84
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:40,820
Where will you go?

85
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,820
This is the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

86
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,006
We have a very good relationship

87
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,390
with the BSA factory in Armoury Road.

88
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,660
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

89
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,686
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

90
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,390
For what purpose?

91
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,420
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

92
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,213
When men come to us with bad intentions,

93
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,900
the family come together.

94
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:21,722
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

95
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,660
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

96
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,900
You're going to be a general...
some day.

97
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,060
So, I need to ask you some questions.

98
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,820
What have you ever fired?

99
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:52,009
Shotgun.

100
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,446
Pistol.

101
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,670
22.

102
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,340
What have you ever killed?

103
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,300
Few rabbits.

104
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,970
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

105
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:10,405
Arthur tells me when they were
taking care of some business

106
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,460
at the betting shop, you ran away.

107
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,420
It was unfair.

108
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,620
Fairness is not a soldier's concern.

109
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,190
You do what you do.

110
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,310
I already have done.

111
00:08:28,317 --> 00:08:29,973
Fair and square.

112
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:32,246
I have killed a man.

113
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,443
Tommy's always right.

114
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,952
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

115
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:46,460
In the Black Country.

116
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,820
My mother was dying.

117
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,526
And the orderly wouldn't give her a bed

118
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,470
cos she was a Gypsy,
she had no insurance.

119
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,983
She never saw the sunrise.

120
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:05,180
Nor did that man who denied her.

121
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:12,060
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

122
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,340
Can you keep a secret?

123
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,683
I know, brother.

124
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,420
I know.

125
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,510
I know.

126
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,710
I stole your keys.

127
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,877
Tuberculoma.

128
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,740
In your brain.

129
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,006
Yeah.

130
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,710
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

131
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,380
Fuck you, Tommy.

132
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,310
I don't need anyone to know, Arthur.

133
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,566
No, you don't, do you?

134
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,646
You don't need anything, do you?

135
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,086
No, I don't need anything.

136
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,820
I don't need anything.

137
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,846
How long have we been dead for, eh?

138
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,380
You and me, how long?

139
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,686
At least now I'll have a certificate.

140
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,219
Wherever it is,

141
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:30,780
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

142
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,830
- Fuck's sake.
- Yeah.

143
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,899
All them bullets that missed.

144
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,220
It's funny, Arthur.

145
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,710
It's funny is what it is.

146
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,180
So don't you fucking weep.

147
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,950
Weep!

148
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,046
When everyone is taken care
of financially,

149
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,590
I will take myself away. On my own.

150
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,020
I don't want anyone...

151
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,950
...anyone who may or may not love me...

152
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,340
...to have to see me crawl...

153
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,025
...or grow insane and helpless.

154
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,860
It would be a cruelty to me and to them.

155
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,350
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

156
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,020
What about Lizzie?

157
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,806
I have some papers I need you to sign

158
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,180
on behalf of the company.

159
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,566
Told Lizzie?

160
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,526
I'm working with the housing minister.

161
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,526
I will be allocating contracts,

162
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,006
construction contracts,
worth Â£10 million.

163
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,640
You haven't told Lizzie?

164
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,481
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

165
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:51,482
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

166
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:54,003
Fuck you and your contracts!

167
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:57,340
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue to earn money.

168
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:01,500
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing it
because it's a good thing.

169
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,806
- Building houses.
- Oh...

170
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,365
Yeah, for ordinary working people...

171
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,286
Oh, yeah, good for you. Fuckin'...

172
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,340
...in the interests of a fairer future.

173
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,606
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

174
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,406
to collect payment
for the shipment, Â£5 million!

175
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,929
Oh, five fucking million?

176
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:23,630
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

177
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,279
And that will be my legacy.

178
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:30,000
Instead of me, there will be money.

179
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,572
Because for most of the people

180
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:34,206
who are close to me, that is what I am!

181
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,926
Fucking money. That is my agency.

182
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,270
Is that all you think you are, eh? Hmm?

183
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,300
Stand up.

184
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,300
You heard me.

185
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,470
Stand up.

186
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,620
On your feet.

187
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,326
- On your fucking feet.
- Arthur...

188
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,726
On your feet, Soldier. On your feet.

189
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,550
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

190
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,340
No!

191
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:06,036
No.

192
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,412
You hear me?

193
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:09,849
Enough.

194
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,249
Enough!

195
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,430
Now you know.

196
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,870
You tell no-one else...

197
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,726
...until I am gone.

198
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,350
Until you're gone, yeah?

199
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:36,516
When the time comes, I'll call you.

200
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:42,020
I'll tell you where. It'll be a wagon.

201
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,580
Fuck your wagon!

202
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,820
You light the flame.

203
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:50,260
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

204
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,226
Get drunk.

205
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,187
Rake the ashes for silver and gold.

206
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,990
Fuck you!

207
00:13:57,996 --> 00:14:00,196
And your fucking plans!

208
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,580
That time, I did let you fucking win.

209
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:26,836
John...

210
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,183
Fuckin' you, John.

211
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,670
Fuckin' both of you.

212
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,470
Arthur...

213
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,766
Arthur.

214
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,126
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

215
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,406
Come here.

216
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:50,457
Come here.

217
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,926
Come here.

218
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,094
Let me see your eyes.

219
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:56,540
I'm clean, man.

220
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,420
The dragon's fucking gone.

221
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,670
Thanks to you. Fucking...
Fucking thanks to you.

222
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,246
You all right?

223
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,590
Come on.

224
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,886
- Fucking...
- Hey, I'm still fucking here.

225
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,710
Pull yourself together,
come on. We have work to do.

226
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,830
Come on!

227
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:10,566
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

228
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,055
Yes. We want Billy.

229
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,780
Sit down, Billy.

230
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,470
Thank you for inviting me, Mr Shelby.

231
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,650
Good to see you again, Billy.

232
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,780
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

233
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:45,525
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about it.

234
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,550
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

235
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,190
Now, we are all gathered...

236
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,686
...and those...

237
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,070
_

238
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,512
_

239
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:11,780
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

240
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,539
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn it.

241
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,286
I heard "tachipen".

242
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,500
Truth. You said something
about the truth.

243
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,234
Truth. The truth is...

244
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,420
...I called men here
that I could trust...

245
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,676
...because I will be going away.

246
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,744
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

247
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:36,340
- which left Liverpool ten days ago.
- Payment from who?

248
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,397
South Boston Irish, Finn.

249
00:17:40,229 --> 00:17:41,660
Bootleggers.

250
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,380
Are you going alone?

251
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,126
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

252
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,660
Michael will be there.

253
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:53,109
Michael is family.

254
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:56,100
Michael will be my guarantee of safety.

255
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,340
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

256
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,020
I need you to go to Arrow House.

257
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,566
I will be leaving Arrow House for good,

258
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,795
and there are things that need removing.

259
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,580
I need men that I can trust.

260
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,340
There is cash, there is valuables.

261
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,046
There is information
about important people

262
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:15,700
that has more value than gold.

263
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:20,672
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

264
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,153
which need digging up

265
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:23,940
before the contractors
start moving earth.

266
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,300
Isiah, you will be in charge.

267
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:29,525
In Arrow House, there is a wine cellar.

268
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,446
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

269
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,647
that are worth more than a man's life.

270
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,926
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

271
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,950
...be like a farewell party.

272
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,590
Are you ready for the party, son?

273
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,335
_

274
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:51,223
Tachipen. The fucking truth again.

275
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,607
What truth?

276
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,594
You'll need shovels, you'll need boxes,

277
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,900
and you'll take the bones to Mr Patches

278
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,020
to put in the furnace at Greenham's.

279
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:01,820
Got it?

280
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,566
Right. Any questions?

281
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,760
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

282
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:11,263
No, Billy. All the fun will be
laid on for you.

283
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,540
So, when is the party, Tom?

284
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,556
Mr Shelby.

285
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,869
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

286
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,206
You mean this Sunday?

287
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,620
Yeah.

288
00:19:30,996 --> 00:19:33,620
And while you're digging fucking holes,

289
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,126
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

290
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,286
It's our wedding anniversary.

291
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,420
Right.

292
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,421
Oh, and, Finn, by the way,

293
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,166
please explain to, erm, what's her name?

294
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,298
- Mary.
- Mary?

295
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,046
- Yes.
- Is it Mary?

296
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:53,726
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

297
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,966
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

298
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,646
Have a look, Shelby. Look.

299
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,846
This means you own the watch,

300
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,420
the watch doesn't own you.

301
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,220
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

302
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,623
Have a whiskey.

303
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,742
Enjoy the party, boys.

304
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:29,340
Want a drink, baby?

305
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:30,701
No.

306
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:33,296
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

307
00:20:35,397 --> 00:20:38,060
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

308
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:48,383
Leave it.

309
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,100
Yeah?

310
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:06,876
Good.

311
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,963
That's good.

312
00:21:10,343 --> 00:21:11,980
Look, I've got to go.

313
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:16,743
Good news, Michael. Listen.

314
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,380
That was our informant in Birmingham.

315
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,780
The Shelby men will all be together
on Sunday.

316
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,566
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

317
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,510
at the bar at the Garrison Tavern.

318
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:39,938
As I recall, the Shelby table is
right next to the windows, correct?

319
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:43,057
- Every table's a Shelby table.
- Yes, but...

320
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,420
...maybe our people
could just drive by and...

321
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,700
...shoot Arthur through the glass
without even getting out of the car.

322
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,620
Michael...

323
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,592
...we've talked about this,
there's no other choice.

324
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,000
This business is between me and Tommy.

325
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:04,561
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

326
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:06,556
Arthur will come after you.

327
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:09,443
He has to die too.

328
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,740
If Arthur's in a bar, he'll be drunk.

329
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,460
Or worse.

330
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,460
At least he'll die without pain.

331
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,790
Who'll do the killing?

332
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:33,499
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

333
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,846
Connor has connections.

334
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,230
They made a deal.

335
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,540
A favour in return for guns.

336
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:44,823
But, Michael...

337
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,530
...whilst the assassin's in this city...

338
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,980
...Tommy has a son.

339
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,846
He's a kid.

340
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:55,629
Kids grow up.

341
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:58,743
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

342
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:03,300
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

343
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:05,696
Do you want a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

344
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,705
I know about the new boy.

345
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,046
I've decided that the illegitimate son

346
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,070
is not a threat. My decision.

347
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,110
Only Arthur.

348
00:23:20,176 --> 00:23:21,416
Michael, baby...

349
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,509
...everything's been agreed.

350
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,610
Everybody wants the same things.

351
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,940
How many men do you think they
killed with bullets and blades?

352
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,390
That's how Tommy became king.

353
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,420
And in three days' time,

354
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:47,940
that's how you will become king.

355
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,220
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead anyway.

356
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:57,003
On Sunday, we'll just...

357
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,900
...give them what they want.

358
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,250
Oswald was called away.
He sent me instead.

359
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,806
Actually, that's not true.

360
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,046
I sent Oswald away and elected myself

361
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,860
to be his representative.

362
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,670
What was it you wanted?

363
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,860
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill before Parliament.

364
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:49,532
You'll need to start drawing up a list

365
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:52,399
of all your land-owning families
with gambling debts,

366
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,540
drug addictions, any other drain
on their resources.

367
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,300
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

368
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,222
using Treasury bonds.

369
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,020
Thomas, why don't we fuck here,

370
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,830
on these benches?

371
00:25:04,996 --> 00:25:06,236
Right now.

372
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,780
We wouldn't be the first.

373
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:13,940
I hear your wife left you.

374
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:26,443
Over the last few months, I've had
some associates of mine...

375
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,031
...break into some of your pals' houses.

376
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:31,671
They stole paperwork.

377
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,671
Letters, bills, bank statements...

378
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:36,460
Are you not upset?

379
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:43,740
This is a list
of all land-owning families

380
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:46,201
facing foreclosure.

381
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,054
And to answer your question...

382
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:57,660
No.

383
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,775
No, I'm not upset that my wife left me.

384
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:07,351
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

385
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,031
But you'll have to cross the floor

386
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,535
cos I refuse to fuck on Tory benches.

387
00:26:26,695 --> 00:26:28,380
Mr Shelby.

388
00:26:30,735 --> 00:26:32,900
I was going to have
this delivered to you,

389
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,525
but I decided to bring it in person.

390
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,140
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

391
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,414
It's in Berlin.

392
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:48,700
We're going to get married in
the presence of the Fuhrer himself.

393
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,871
Were you having fun?

394
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,500
Making paper aeroplanes.

395
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:01,175
I'm afraid, er...

396
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,500
...I have business. I will be in Canada.

397
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:08,901
Pity.

398
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,695
Oh, and, er...

399
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:19,391
...the other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

400
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:21,055
was to tell you that, after our wedding,

401
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,871
you must understand, Mr Shelby,

402
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,631
that if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

403
00:27:27,655 --> 00:27:29,575
I will have you killed.

404
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:34,855
Come, Diana.

405
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,140
Just think...

406
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:43,111
...very soon crumbling old
institutions like this one

407
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:46,575
will be swept away and become
a thing of ancient memory.

408
00:27:48,794 --> 00:27:50,434
Fly safe.

409
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:00,100
Be careful with this baby.

410
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:05,580
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

411
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:27,191
Mr Shelby called to say to expect you.

412
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,911
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

413
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,604
We're hearing so many rumours about
what's happening to the house.

414
00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:36,322
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is

415
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:38,215
you don't ask questions.

416
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:44,335
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

417
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,511
OK, let's find these bottles of wine

418
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:50,575
worth more than a man's life.

419
00:30:44,855 --> 00:30:46,471
There's only one guest here.

420
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,071
The rest of the rooms are free

421
00:30:48,095 --> 00:30:50,151
if you want to use them while you wait.

422
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:52,580
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

423
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,271
There was a storm last night.

424
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:58,620
Last of a hurricane. Boats all came in.

425
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,855
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

426
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,300
Then your friend is dead.

427
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,001
Wind was like...

428
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,191
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

429
00:31:12,215 --> 00:31:13,678
My name is not fucking Mickey,

430
00:31:13,702 --> 00:31:16,615
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

431
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:23,231
Another one.

432
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:35,575
There will be a war...

433
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:38,735
...and one of you will die.

434
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,071
Which one I cannot tell.

435
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:43,975
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

436
00:31:44,895 --> 00:31:46,740
Where the fuck were you?

437
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:49,911
She's gone Tommy. She's gone.

438
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,031
The devils who did this will pay, Ruby.

439
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:56,071
Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

440
00:31:57,855 --> 00:32:00,711
- How long?
- Perhaps 18 months.

441
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:03,151
I will change. And change for good.

442
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:05,351
What is this good that you have become?

443
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:08,575
Kill... and kill.

444
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:43,255
What's going on?

445
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:49,191
What the fuck is this?

446
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:51,311
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

447
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:52,751
It is now you're here.

448
00:32:52,775 --> 00:32:54,591
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

449
00:32:54,615 --> 00:32:58,631
In the kitchen. All the booze
is in the kitchen.

450
00:32:58,655 --> 00:32:59,815
All right.

451
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:16,951
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

452
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:19,511
but God steps in and says,

453
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:22,574
"No, this is grievous, mindless evil!"

454
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:24,994
Where is he, Jeremiah?

455
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:27,335
In heaven, looking down.

456
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:35,317
God tells us that blood is given to
him from us.

457
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,351
Why don't you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

458
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,005
Well, there's no longer any power

459
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,991
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

460
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,751
Why not? What do you mean?
What happened?

461
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,071
I thought there were
going to be girls here.

462
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,711
Who need girls when you're in
a house bound for hell?

463
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,095
Fuck d'ya mean?

464
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,655
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

465
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,111
Fuck!

466
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:09,591
Fuck!

467
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:12,151
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

468
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,975
It's got a death sentence.

469
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,151
I don't want a drink.

470
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,471
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

471
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,316
- Billy?
- Yeah?

472
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,031
Got to wait until all
the bodies are buried

473
00:34:27,055 --> 00:34:28,871
before you start digging them back up.

474
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,895
What the fuck does that mean?

475
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:35,295
I'm a fucking Shelby.

476
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,615
So am I.

477
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:02,140
He's here.

478
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:46,860
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

479
00:36:45,895 --> 00:36:48,271
Charge is set to blow in 30 minutes.

480
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:50,163
That's at exactly 16.20.

481
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:51,367
Everybody got that?

482
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,575
I'll do it.

483
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:00,871
This is between me and Tommy.

484
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,180
I'll do it with my own hand.

485
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,180
I'll come with you.

486
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,887
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

487
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,895
Easy.

488
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,383
It's just a pity
you didn't have the guts

489
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:39,335
to shoot him face to face.

490
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:44,031
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

491
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,431
She always said it won't be a bullet

492
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:48,295
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

493
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:55,111
Hey, lads.

494
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:56,911
Over by the bridge.

495
00:37:56,935 --> 00:37:59,014
Big, big fish.

496
00:37:59,038 --> 00:38:01,271
Poisson. Grande.

497
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:03,187
Go on.

498
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:09,375
Take the gun, Finn.

499
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,711
Arthur says if you don't do it,

500
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,804
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

501
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:20,271
What the fuck do you know
about family? You're not family!

502
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:23,655
You're the son of a fucking whore!

503
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:28,711
Just take the gun and do it, Finn.

504
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:31,095
Take the fucking gun.

505
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:43,631
Now you have the gun, Finn,
you have the gun.

506
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,615
Use it on these fucks!

507
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,072
Argh!

508
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:03,457
Charlie Strong told me,

509
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,151
"When you give Finn the gun,

510
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:07,031
"make sure the first two chambers
are empty."

511
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:10,700
Good old Uncle Charlie.

512
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:34,975
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

513
00:39:36,695 --> 00:39:40,660
By order of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

514
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:43,551
I will come for you.

515
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,695
I will fucking come for you!

516
00:40:33,615 --> 00:40:36,391
...That find me faulting them

517
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:39,885
who govern like dogs in Garrison Lane.

518
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:42,777
Hear this, then came Jesus forth

519
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,605
wearing the crown of thorns

520
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:46,285
and the purple robe,

521
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:49,965
and Pilate said, "Behold the man,

522
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,325
"he is the man."

523
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,005
Not the Peaky Blinders!

524
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:57,965
We see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their...

525
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,349
Hmm.

526
00:42:16,922 --> 00:42:20,458
Order your man to drop it. Order him.

527
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,069
Empty the fucking gun. Tell him.

528
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,218
You all right, Charlie?

529
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:32,525
All good here, Arthur.

530
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,645
Let's move.

531
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:38,589
Take you out to the street
cos I don't want to spoil my pub.

532
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,485
You'd shoot us like dogs?

533
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:55,700
No. I don't shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

534
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,709
Fuck! Fuck!

535
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:00,595
Fuck!

536
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:14,805
Oh, Lord!

537
00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:19,749
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

538
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:53,789
Let's go and see!

539
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:00,205
Kids, no, come here. I said, come here!

540
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:02,685
What have I told you about running off?

541
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,885
Don't pick up things. Don't.

542
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:07,229
Come here, come on.

543
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:16,525
Emily! Emily, come on.

544
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:19,725
If you get lost in the fog,
the Peaky Blinders will get you.

545
00:47:22,469 --> 00:47:23,829
Jeremiah...

546
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:29,220
...let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

547
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:46,949
Fuck!

548
00:47:49,189 --> 00:47:50,366
Fuck!

549
00:49:01,389 --> 00:49:03,365
Come here.

550
00:49:03,389 --> 00:49:05,580
Shh...

551
00:49:08,983 --> 00:49:10,749
Breathe.

552
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:19,429
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

553
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,885
She was my Aunt Polly.

554
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,109
My Aunt Polly.

555
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:32,029
Vengeance is for the Lord...

556
00:49:37,549 --> 00:49:40,029
Not in Small Heath, it ain't.

557
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:45,702
Rest in peace, Pol.

558
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:20,525
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

559
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:22,116
We're still in France.

560
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,449
OK.

561
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:09,460
I see him coming out of the fog.

562
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:31,780
How was the flight?

563
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:35,485
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

564
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,989
Whiskey.

565
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,389
Hello, Michael.

566
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:44,635
Tommy.

567
00:51:53,582 --> 00:51:55,782
Give me another.

568
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,300
We want you to take us to where the
opium is being stored.

569
00:52:02,149 --> 00:52:05,045
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

570
00:52:05,069 --> 00:52:06,596
for the full amount.

571
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:09,369
$5 million.

572
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:12,820
$5 million.

573
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,296
Let's go.

574
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:23,845
I'll go with Tommy.

575
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:25,549
You boys follow behind.

576
00:52:31,229 --> 00:52:34,860
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

577
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:30,376
Mum...

578
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:34,980
...it's done.

579
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:38,896
It's over.

580
00:54:41,202 --> 00:54:43,562
And may God forgive me.

581
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:21,149
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

582
00:55:22,962 --> 00:55:25,580
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

583
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:32,229
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

584
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,957
Goodbye, Michael.

585
00:55:44,982 --> 00:55:46,422
Goodbye, Johnny.

586
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:49,700
You're a good man.

587
00:55:53,362 --> 00:55:57,202
I'm going to go look at the fog, Tom.

588
00:56:03,062 --> 00:56:04,782
Speak to me.

589
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,242
Speak to me, Michael.

590
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:14,685
- You killed her.
- Polly made her own choices, Michael.

591
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:16,285
No...

592
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:20,060
No-one close to you makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

593
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:23,605
Not Arthur,

594
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:27,109
not me, not Ada.

595
00:56:28,682 --> 00:56:30,660
We can't escape you.

596
00:56:33,508 --> 00:56:36,068
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

597
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,149
Polly was half of me.

598
00:56:43,602 --> 00:56:45,562
Still visits me in my dreams.

599
00:56:47,915 --> 00:56:49,795
She'll visit me no more.

600
00:57:03,222 --> 00:57:05,662
I have no limitations.

601
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,285
I smell the smell of roasting Irishmen.

602
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,429
Oh, yes, hello.

603
00:58:16,629 --> 00:58:19,125
I also smell the smell of tobacco,

604
00:58:19,149 --> 00:58:21,868
which is forbidden in my presence
for all except for one,

605
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:23,669
my new wife, Edna.

606
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:28,245
The Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

607
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:30,925
I now own half of Boston,

608
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:36,060
so, out of respect
for my restored authority...

609
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:40,300
...put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

610
00:58:41,869 --> 00:58:43,725
Hello, Alfie.

611
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:45,245
I heard it was a good wedding.

612
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:47,445
Yeah, it was, actually. Thank you.

613
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:49,925
Edna's from a family circus.

614
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:52,565
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

615
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:56,405
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

616
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:58,165
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

617
00:58:58,189 --> 00:59:00,405
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

618
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:02,685
and even the Gentile what normally
fucking hate me,

619
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,509
they waved with their hankies.

620
00:59:06,729 --> 00:59:08,049
Justice.

621
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:13,875
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

622
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,165
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

623
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:18,645
he's ascending to the heavens!

624
00:59:18,669 --> 00:59:21,085
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

625
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:23,285
I can see with this eye. I'm not blind.

626
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,565
This eye is the eye of a dead man.

627
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:28,365
Dead men can see through life
like it was a curtain

628
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:30,885
that billows with the flicker
of truth upon it.

629
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:33,165
And I can see with this eye, Tommy,

630
00:59:33,189 --> 00:59:37,020
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

631
00:59:37,429 --> 00:59:39,045
Unlike you,

632
00:59:39,069 --> 00:59:41,285
who, on Judgment Day,

633
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:45,245
is probably truly fucked when the
other shoe drops.

634
00:59:45,269 --> 00:59:46,709
Hmm?

635
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:52,469
All right, Tommy? How are you keeping?

636
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,029
You know, Alfie...

637
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,005
...so many people,

638
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,900
so many times

639
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:04,380
going to so much trouble to kill me.

640
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,765
I'm fucking dying anyway.

641
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,685
We're all dying anyway.

642
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:10,260
No.

643
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:14,125
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

644
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,125
not a knife.

645
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:18,405
Is it clap? Is it clap?

646
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:21,205
No, not even that noble.

647
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:23,285
What are you trying to say?

648
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:26,445
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

649
01:00:26,469 --> 01:00:27,885
to you as part of this deal.

650
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:31,685
Are you saying you're
just going to die in your bed?

651
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:34,605
I'm not going to die in bed, Alfie.
Who fucking dies in bed?

652
01:00:34,629 --> 01:00:37,405
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

653
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,909
- Good people, eh?
- Hmm.

654
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,965
Good people.

655
01:00:41,989 --> 01:00:43,845
And yet here we are, Alfie,

656
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,149
after all this time, just you and me.

657
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:52,109
And I crossed the line.

658
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:56,835
Michael.

659
01:00:58,902 --> 01:01:00,382
Polly.

660
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:04,060
Ruby.

661
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:11,685
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

662
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,485
you might be better served expressing it

663
01:01:14,509 --> 01:01:17,125
to someone who gives a fuck,

664
01:01:17,149 --> 01:01:20,365
or perhaps to somebody who is being paid

665
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:22,325
to pretend to have to.

666
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:26,660
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

667
01:01:28,829 --> 01:01:30,540
And as for death,

668
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:33,525
speaking as someone who has been dead

669
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:35,765
for a number of years,

670
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:38,180
I can only heartily recommend it.

671
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:43,780
Well, Alfie, your opera is complete.

672
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:54,020
Shall we go and witness the final act?

673
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:41,500
Whenever you're ready, boys.

674
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:25,445
That's enough.

675
01:03:27,309 --> 01:03:29,029
Thank you all for coming.

676
01:03:30,709 --> 01:03:32,700
Well, at least I can say that, er...

677
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:35,750
...I am one of those rare politicians

678
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:38,229
who actually makes good on his promises.

679
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,805
Country estate,

680
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:46,125
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

681
01:03:46,149 --> 01:03:49,493
I improved my own home
with good intentions

682
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:52,069
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

683
01:03:57,002 --> 01:03:58,522
Now I'm back where we began...

684
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,749
...with horses and caravans...

685
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:06,020
...vagabonds and thieves.

686
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:12,462
Frances, sit down, please.

687
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,020
I'd like to raise a toast.

688
01:04:24,348 --> 01:04:25,628
A simple toast.

689
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:30,325
To family.

690
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,045
- To family.
- To family.

691
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:36,420
Sometimes it is shelter from the storm.

692
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:40,500
Sometimes it is the storm itself.

693
01:04:51,342 --> 01:04:53,140
I'm planning on going away for a bit.

694
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,555
After I'm gone...

695
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,380
Ada...

696
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,762
...in this family...

697
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:07,322
...it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

698
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:10,729
Remember that.

699
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,285
And if ever a seat
is to become available

700
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:16,725
in this ugly old city, you should run.

701
01:05:18,656 --> 01:05:19,712
Where's Arthur?

702
01:05:19,737 --> 01:05:21,940
He went for a walk down the river.

703
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:24,506
He said he's not good at farewells

704
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:27,470
so he's decided to
go catch a trout instead.

705
01:05:31,082 --> 01:05:33,202
He told me to tell you that...

706
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:38,335
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

707
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:42,082
"..very soon. Love, Arthur."

708
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:51,580
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

709
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,380
You watch him, Linda.

710
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:57,660
You love him.

711
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:06,165
Charles, I want you
to look after your mum.

712
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,389
You tell her I'm sorry, you hear me?

713
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,722
I want you to be the bes...

714
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:25,229
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

715
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:37,189
Thanks, Curly.

716
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:56,205
Tom, the horse.

717
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:57,869
Shut up, Curly.

718
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:06,900
Is she hitched, Johnny?

719
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:11,180
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

720
01:07:11,669 --> 01:07:14,565
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

721
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:16,445
Tommy, you come to me with everything.

722
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:19,845
- You always come to me.
- Not this time. Not this one, sister.

723
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,322
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

724
01:07:24,822 --> 01:07:26,822
Tommy!

725
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:36,709
_

726
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:42,109
In the bleak midwinter...

727
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:47,469
Dad... Dad, come out, come out!

728
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:50,309
Dad, it's me.

729
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:06,109
Did Polly send you?

730
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:09,580
Did Polly send you?

731
01:12:10,309 --> 01:12:11,685
Or am I dead already?

732
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:13,429
No.

733
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:16,860
You're not dead.

734
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:19,845
You're not even sick.

735
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,582
But I am, my darling.

736
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:24,815
I'm sick.

737
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:27,325
Sick like you was.

738
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:29,525
No. Not true.

739
01:12:29,549 --> 01:12:32,349
I know it. You've got to live, Daddy.

740
01:12:35,069 --> 01:12:37,149
You let the fire go out.

741
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,845
Light the fire again and get warm,

742
01:12:41,869 --> 01:12:45,029
and you will see that you must live.

743
01:13:47,309 --> 01:13:50,005
You're not even sick, Daddy.

744
01:14:26,688 --> 01:14:28,768
Fucking Gypsies.

745
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,005
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

746
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:41,885
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir, but there was no-one there.

747
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:44,405
Well, go back up there
and set fire to the fucking thing.

748
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:45,980
Yes, sir.

749
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:54,620
Have you filled the car with petrol?

750
01:15:02,029 --> 01:15:05,229
I said, have you filled the car up
with petrol?

751
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:10,709
How was the wedding in Berlin?

752
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:15,869
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

753
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,780
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

754
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:25,725
Never knew you were so well connected.

755
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:28,165
Oh, and the doctor at St Thomas's

756
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:30,245
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

757
01:15:30,269 --> 01:15:32,285
second set of X-rays?

758
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,260
A maid of honour at the same wedding.

759
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:38,060
All so very well fucking connected.

760
01:15:40,262 --> 01:15:41,982
On your knees, Holford.

761
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:50,365
I'm guessing you people all decided

762
01:15:50,389 --> 01:15:52,725
that the only person

763
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:55,260
who could ever kill Tommy Shelby

764
01:15:56,069 --> 01:15:57,989
is Tommy Shelby himself.

765
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:03,485
You made me believe death was coming.

766
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:06,622
Let my nature do the rest, eh?

767
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:13,860
You may not have tuberculoma, Mr Shelby,

768
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:16,782
but you are sick.

769
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:19,182
I know you.

770
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,980
You are sick with guilt.

771
01:16:24,115 --> 01:16:27,115
Sick of death at your own hand.

772
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:30,442
Sick of who you were.

773
01:16:33,069 --> 01:16:34,845
You are no longer the kind of man

774
01:16:34,869 --> 01:16:37,460
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

775
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:47,020
Tommy, you have been on a journey

776
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:50,955
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

777
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:54,922
You cannot go back.

778
01:16:56,589 --> 01:16:58,469
You are a different man.

779
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:02,449
The gun no longer belongs in your hand.

780
01:17:09,062 --> 01:17:10,862
Oh, but I am back.

781
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:15,500
Back from under the ground.

782
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:19,140
Close your eyes.

783
01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:24,169
Close your eyes.

784
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:49,062
The eleventh hour.

785
01:17:50,589 --> 01:17:52,140
Armistice.

786
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:56,876
Peace at last.

787
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:01,809
Peace at last.
