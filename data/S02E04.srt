﻿1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,950
A vacancy has appeared and you're
going to fill it.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,950
From now on, Mr Shelby,
you shut your Gypsy mouth

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,950
and listen to your instructions.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,950
I know it was you who carried
out the murder of Mr Duggan.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,310
You are on my hook, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,830
~ Name? ~ Harold Hancox.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,030
~ Have you ever been arrested?
~ No.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,390
Arthur, we can stand him up.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,270
'Last night, one of our men had
his throat cut in Winson Green.'

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,870
I'm not real!

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,990
'Gentlemen? This is your cousin.
Polly's son, Michael.'

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,550
~ I want to go with them.
~ Over my dead body.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,950
Do we hear 800 guineas? 850.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,750
'May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.'

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,710
~ So will you consider me?
~ I will consider you.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,350
Thomas Shelby?

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,750
'Did they behave themselves?'

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
They were really amazing.

You might think this is a curious
place for me to suggest a meeting,

30
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,830
but...

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,480
your surprises have
only just begun.

32
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,350
You look a little unsteady,
Mr Shelby.

33
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,040
Take a seat.

34
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,200
You're working together.

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,000
Blowing up the Garrison
was your idea.

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
You who chose me.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,030
It's funny, I thought the
Fenians had a policy...

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,110
~ Enough. ~ .. of not mixing the
personal with the political.

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,030
~ I said enough. ~ I think
I will decide on what is enough.

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,670
Who's in charge here then, eh?
Who's in charge?

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,270
Right, let me understand this.

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,110
~ You answer to an agent of the Crown.
~ Perhaps we can just...

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,070
~ Very interesting.
~ Perhaps we can stick to the agenda.

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,590
~ Whose agenda?
~ There is a form of words here.

45
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
~ Whose words? ~ Arrogant bastard.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,230
~ I'm not accustomed to being spoken
to like that. ~ Just come to order

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,590
I am here to listen,
but not to the fucking infantry.

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,910
Enough! Jesus!

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
Now...

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,190
.. some weeks ago, Mr Shelby
carried out a military mission

51
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,150
on behalf of pro-treaty Republicans
here in Birmingham.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,470
You...

53
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,350
working for the King.

54
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,750
~ There is a unique political
situation. ~ Yeah? How does that feel?

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,350
~ Let us... ~ Tell me.
How does that fucking feel?

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,710
.. stick to the form of words.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,870
~ Temporarily, we have a
shared interest. ~ Oh, I see.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,510
~ Shall we just stop him laughing?
~ You want me to stop laughing?

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,950
~ Explain this, pal. ~ Following
the success of your mission...

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,790
~ We're going to make you do it again.
~ Will you shut up?

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,230
Can we just conduct
ourselves here, please?

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,830
~ Conduct ourselves! ~ Please.

63
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,520
No-one in this room wants to breathe
the same air as anyone else.

64
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,990
~ Nevertheless... ~ Nevertheless
the pro-treaty Paddies

65
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,080
and the King want the same man dead.

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Am I right?

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,590
~ Why him?
~ Did you ask why in France?

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,840
~ Yeah. ~ So, it's the same answer -
because.

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,150
Why me?

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,520
~ Because. ~ Because.

71
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,550
Because if anybody
connects me to this,

72
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,910
it will be assumed
that it was a criminal act

73
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,790
and not a political one.

74
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,470
No, you need not fear being
connected to the killing

75
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,390
because I will see to it that
no connection is ever made.

76
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,870
You will have complete
immunity after the fact.

77
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,190
But, in the execution, you will get
no help from agents of the Crown.

78
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,200
And we can't be seen to be involved.

79
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,190
You have been chosen, Mr Shelby,

80
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,030
and there really is no choice.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,390
No equals bang,

82
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,200
and your man here will shed no tears
as he looks the other way.

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,470
Nevertheless...

84
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,320
I say no.

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Mr Shelby?

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,230
What about your export licence,
Mr Shelby?

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,720
You had a deal with Mr Churchill.

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,110
The one with the mouth,
Donal Henry, he is a spy.

89
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,270
He is working for the Irregulars
against the pro-treaty Paddies.

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,550
He reports every fucking
word back to them.

91
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,830
No, it's not possible.

92
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,670
They've both been security vetted
by my own department.

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,310
I have men in places
your men can't go.

94
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,110
Donal Henry meets the
anti-treaty Paddies in the back room

95
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,520
of the Mother Red Cap in
Saltley sometimes twice a week.

96
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,470
These Irish enemies are
fucking brothers and cousins.

97
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,360
You are stepping into a world
you don't understand.

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,870
If what you're saying is true,
he'll be dealt with.

99
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,480
Bring me proof the spy is dead
and we have a deal.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,120
~ Mr Shelby. ~ Billy boy.
~ Watch it.

101
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,160
Now on you go.

102
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Right, boys, let's go!

103
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,190
Fuck you!

104
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
Mario!

105
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,160
Mario!

106
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,710
Mario!

107
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Come here.

108
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Sabini's day is done.

109
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
I'll protect you now.

110
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,070
Oh, shut up!

111
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,360
Stop fucking whingeing.

112
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,430
Due to my razor blade

113
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,590
and a few complaints
from the neighbours

114
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,200
about the terrible fucking music...

115
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,750
Do you want to
tell them or should I?

116
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,360
This place is under new
management...

117
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,590
.. by order of the Peaky Blinders.

118
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,040
Yes?

119
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,990
Somebody to see you, Mr Shelby.

120
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,910
He says he's come about the
position of accounts clerk.

121
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
Send him in.

122
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,800
~ Just through here, sir. ~ Thank you.

123
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,960
Michael...

124
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
.. vacancy's been filled.

125
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Not according to this morning's
paper.

126
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,550
At school, I was top of the
class in mathematics

127
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,350
and I did a night-school course in
accountancy at Worcester College.

128
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,910
Mum says you've had
six different accountant clerks

129
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,280
in the last six months.

130
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,000
When respectable men see the
other things you do, they leave.

131
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,520
But I, like Lizzie out there,
already know what you do.

132
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,230
Mum says you want to be 80% legal
within two years.

133
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,110
~ Three.
~ I can help.

134
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,030
I know both sides and
you know you can trust me.

135
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,040
I want to help you, Tommy,
become legal.

136
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,280
Do the right thing.

137
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,920
I want to be proud of this family.

138
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
Does Polly know you're here,
Michael?

139
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm 18 on Friday -
I go where I please.

140
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,400
You phone your mother.

141
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,000
Good luck.

142
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,270
We're not open for winnings yet.

143
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm here to see Thomas Shelby.

144
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,270
I have an appointment.

145
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,960
Come in.

146
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,550
~ May Carleton. ~ Mr Shelby
has his proper meetings

147
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,560
in his other office.

148
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,870
This was the address
that he gave me.

149
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,550
~ He gave you THIS address?
~ He said it was a gambling den.

150
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,590
I told him that
I've wanted to see one

151
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,950
since I'm always reading
about them in the papers.

152
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,870
Quite the big scandal
in the Telegraph lately.

153
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,880
Anyway, he said that
I could come and have a look.

154
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,390
And now I feel like a bit of an idiot

155
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,110
because I'm early and he's late
and I have no idea how to behave.

156
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,520
In a gambling den?

157
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,550
I'll wait in the car.

158
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,470
If I open the door again,
they'll all want to come in...

159
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,200
like flies.

160
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
So what are you?

161
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,830
W-what am I?

162
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,360
To Thomas?

163
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm going to train his
racehorse... for Epsom.

164
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,000
You know horses?

165
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,910
Yes. You?

166
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,240
Born riding.

167
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,400
I slept in a manger when I was a
baby.

168
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,150
I was born riding, too.

169
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,310
There's a fucking
great Riley parked out there

170
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,670
and nobody's watching it.

171
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
John, this woman says
she's training Thomas' horse.

172
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,960
He's told us a lot about you.

173
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,670
Don't know where he is, do you?

174
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,030
Sorry I'm late.
There was a family matter.

175
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,270
Esme, keep it locked
up for a minute.

176
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,920
~ Yes, Thomas.
~ I'll show you around.

177
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,920
So... be my guest.

178
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,200
That's my brother Arthur's office.

179
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,030
Down there is
my brother John's office -

180
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,680
that's where we slate
the runners and riders.

181
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,360
It's so out in the open.
What about the police?

182
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,160
What about them?

183
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,830
When I drove into Small Heath,

184
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,870
I thought I was going to get
murdered...

185
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
then I mentioned your name.

186
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,720
It was like being escorted
to see a king.

187
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,520
~ You came here to get my girl, right?
~ Right.

188
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,670
She looks in very good condition,

189
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,070
considering she's not been
out on the gallops.

190
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,030
Curly's the best horseman
in England.

191
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,670
I have a man called Mickey
who'd argue the point.

192
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,230
Ah, but Curly here is
half horse himself.

193
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,470
She's blessed. Very blessed.

194
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,430
Well, she's from the best stock.

195
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,590
But I'd rather have a coloured pony.
Mixed blood is stronger.

196
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,230
Not to win the Derby, Curly.

197
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,750
Don't like them racing, Tommy,
not the way they beat them.

198
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,520
~ She's all yours.
~ Thank you.

199
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,510
He gets sad when one leaves.

200
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,870
~ What time is your box van coming?
~ Midday.

201
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,830
Maybe you've got time to take
the lady to the Garrison,

202
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,200
show her the spa and
the tearooms.

203
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,640
I'd like that, why not?

204
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,070
I just had it done up.
There was a fire.

205
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,670
It's...

206
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,190
Yeah.

207
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,720
What do you drink?

208
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,720
So early, but gin.

209
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,480
Goodness. With something?

210
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,600
Like what?

211
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,480
Tonic water or...

212
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
Erm... we have... cordial.

213
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
There's not much room
in there but...

214
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,600
You want to fuck me, Mrs Carleton?

215
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,350
Perhaps because I...

216
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,080
Perhaps because I represent
something to you?

217
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,310
We should have this conversation
before the booze

218
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,000
starts talking for us.

219
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,920
You have a horse.

220
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,190
Yes, I have a horse.

221
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,190
The horse is why I'm here...

222
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,110
purely that.

223
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,430
And because you're paying me a
lot of money to train your horse,

224
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,310
that's why I'm here,

225
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,640
purely that.

226
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,280
Good.

227
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,110
Good. Well, a toast, then.

228
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,040
To the horse, to the Derby.

229
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
~ Cheers. ~ Cheers.

230
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,040
So is that what you say to women?

231
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,670
Only if I don't know what they want.

232
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,760
And what if they don't want to fuck?

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,350
Then life is simpler.

234
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
You want a simple life?

235
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,520
Do I look like a man
who wants a simple life, eh?

236
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,360
So what do you want?

237
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,710
For what I'm paying you,
Mrs Carleton,

238
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,680
I want a horse that'll pay out
at Epsom on an each-way bet.

239
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,790
Before I took your account,

240
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,840
I did some credit checks on you.

241
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,360
Apparently, you don't exist.

242
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
My existence is questionable.

243
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,440
Gypsies don't like registers.

244
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,750
You see, I'm not a Gypsy
like you mean.

245
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,720
But you did register for France.

246
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,230
I also sent your name
to the War Office -

247
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,550
I have friends there.

248
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,840
You won two medals for gallantry.

249
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,320
Does that really impress you,
Mrs Carleton?

250
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,200
Call me May.

251
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,270
Charlie says the box van is here.

252
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,880
Thank you, Finn.

253
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,760
You know, I still don't know what
you're going to call your horse.

254
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,600
The horse will be called
Grace's Secret.

255
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,680
Grace's Secret.

256
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,600
I told him he definitely
can't take the job.

257
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,790
He said "All right,
I'll move to London, then."

258
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,680
I said, "I won't give
in to blackmail. No is no."

259
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,470
Well... that settles it, then.

260
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,310
I'll give the job
to the other candidate.

261
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,350
He's much better qualified anyway.

262
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,190
Michael did City And Guilds -
six months.

263
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,230
Yeah, but he doesn't
know racing, Poll.

264
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,750
He knows horses,
but he doesn't know racing.

265
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,990
This other boy, he knows racing.

266
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,920
He's good. He's a fast learner.

267
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
What if Michael really leaves?

268
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,910
You just got to let him go, Poll.

269
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,630
He'll get a job in
an office in London.

270
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,110
I'm sure he'll write to you.

271
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,750
He made a big speech

272
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,190
about wanting to help you
build up a respectable business.

273
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,430
Oh, he's like his dad,
he could make me cry.

274
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,030
There are trains to London.

275
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,350
So I just let him leave?

276
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,280
Every month or so he'd be back...

277
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,830
.. unless of course he meets a girl.

278
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Then, who knows?

279
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,310
Oh, my God.

280
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,030
You want him to do this job.

281
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Polly, I want what you want.

282
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,590
What about this other more
qualified candidate?

283
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,030
Mmm...

284
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,280
Well, I lied, there isn't one.

285
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
How much are you paying?

286
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,630
~ The advertised rate.
~ Like hell.

287
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,640
~ Three bob. ~ Like hell.

288
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,790
~ Three and six. ~ Four.

289
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,360
Four it is.

290
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,470
~ I love him, Tom.
~ I know.

291
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,670
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

292
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,120
put him charge of the new. Agreed?

293
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,840
Agreed.

294
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,550
Well, Finn, you've got two choices -
mild or mild.

295
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,110
~ Mild. ~ There you go.

296
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,680
Here he is, look.

297
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,470
Happy birthday, Michael.

298
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,430
18 years old. You're a man today.

299
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,550
~ Give him a drink, John Boy.
~ There you go, lad. ~ And after that,

300
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,710
we'll go to find you
a lady of the night.

301
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,960
Arthur!

302
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,790
Michael.

303
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,710
What's that?

304
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,720
So you're never late for work.

305
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,430
Welcome to the business, Michael.

306
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,150
~ Welcome to the business. ~ Thank you.

307
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,910
Right, come on,
let's get him drunk. Come here, you.

308
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,190
All right, whisky.

309
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,350
No whisky, he's at work tomorrow.
Give him only dark mild.

310
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,310
~ A toast. ~ Toast. ~ To Michael.

311
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,960
To Michael.

312
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,840
Are you all right?

313
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,630
~ What is it? Just us? ~ Just us.

314
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,160
Are we celebrating?

315
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,200
Just taste this.

316
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,790
What do you think, Arthur?

317
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,270
Yeah, it's good.
Good stuff, really nice.

318
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,030
Too good for the Garrison.

319
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
I suppose we could shift it
to the toffs at the Eden Club.

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,470
Why? What is it?

321
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
That is part of an export drive.

322
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,790
We now have a secure warehouse
in Camden Town

323
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,790
and secure passage to the
Poplar Docks.

324
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,710
So, on Monday morning,

325
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,390
we'll be sending out
our first export crate.

326
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,110
A crate of Riley car spares...

327
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,990
bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

328
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,840
Where there's prohibition.

329
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,070
Where there is prohibition.

330
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,750
All over Canada and America,

331
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,510
people are making their own booze
in bathtubs.

332
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,390
But rich people in New York,
in Toronto and Boston

333
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,510
are still paying a lot of
money for the real stuff.

334
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,750
So, on Monday, the first
Shelby company crate

335
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,750
will contain a thousand
Riley carburettors.

336
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,870
But hidden in the packing
will be 500 bottles

337
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,680
of the finest quality
single malt Scotch whisky.

338
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,350
And we, Shelby's, have a licence

339
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,150
granted by the
Minister Of The Empire himself,

340
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,790
which means our crates
won't be searched.

341
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,830
And, Polly, all of the whisky
will be packed at the docks,

342
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,670
so Michael can do the books
without being involved.

343
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,270
Like I've been telling
you all for a year now...

344
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,760
motor cars are the future.

345
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,630
So, how is your life then, Tom?

346
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,350
On the up, Johnny, on the up.

347
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,910
But, Tom, really, come on,
how is it?

348
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,070
You know I hate to
see you not even married yet.

349
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,710
I have a fine looking cousin,
she'll make your life hell.

350
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,150
You deserve her!

351
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
We haven't had a good old
wedding in a long time.

352
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,390
Have you had a look inside
these boxes, then, Johnny?

353
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,950
What do I want to look
at car parts, Tommy,

354
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,680
when I haven't even got a car?

355
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,990
Faith in family's a fine thing, eh?

356
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,950
And I wouldn't even be counting.

357
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,870
25 becomes 24, then 24 it is.

358
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,830
Oh, you know I'm no good
with numbers, Tom.

359
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,950
And if 24 ever became 23...

360
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,550
then that'd be tax.

361
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,670
We don't pay tax.

362
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
No, Tom.

363
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,720
Good man.

364
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,150
I put an iron door on,

365
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,110
and we've put iron bars on the
windows and across the skylights.

366
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,030
~ Good. ~ So what will you be
keeping in here, Tommy?

367
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,680
Temptation, Billy. Temptation.

368
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,760
Morning, Arthur. I was just passing.

369
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,310
I think I'm in fucking love.

370
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Drink!

371
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,680
She don't know where to look.

372
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,520
Whisky, Tommy?

373
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,430
No, I've got a long drive ahead.

374
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,950
You off home?

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,710
Mm-hmmm. Eventually.

376
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,080
To Birmingham.

377
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,000
What's this?

378
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,350
Olives.

379
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes, it's miscellaneous.

380
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,390
It's, erm, olives.

381
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Sticks, you know, with little bits
of fucking onion and things.

382
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,000
That's what that is.

383
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,200
We've taken 600 pounds on olives.

384
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,560
Yeah, with little bits of onion.

385
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
I told you, Arthur...

386
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,830
.. the dealers sell the cocaine,
we take a cut.

387
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,030
We don't sell direct.

388
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,910
The Home Secretary's cracking down

389
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,030
and I don't want this...

390
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,680
.. to fuck up everything else,
you understand?

391
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,950
I understand.

392
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,520
How much of that 600
came out of your pocket?

393
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,190
It's under control.

394
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,280
I put you down here cos people
are scared of you, Arthur.

395
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,160
But if you don't straighten up,
it'll be John's turn in London.

396
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,310
No need.

397
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,680
I can handle it.

398
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
It's under control?

399
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
It's under control.

400
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,240
Fucking tidy profit, though, eh?

401
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,640
It's happening, Tom.

402
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,920
Good.

403
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,160
Good.

404
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,120
Straighten up, soldier.

405
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,760
Yes, sir, Sergeant Major.

406
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,240
What's your business?

407
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,080
Sorry, I'm, er, I'm lost here.

408
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,880
~ Yeah, well, you can't stop here.
Move on. ~ All right.

409
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,520
23 seconds.

410
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,160
It's all right, Ada,
it'll be Andrew for me.

411
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,320
Oh.

412
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,150
I'm looking for Ada.

413
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,560
Who are you?

414
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,710
Ada.

415
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,470
I asked you a question.

416
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,430
It's all right, James.

417
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,670
This is my brother.

418
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,990
Who's he?

419
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,390
He rents a room.

420
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,230
You need to rent out rooms?

421
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,110
Actually, she doesn't charge rent.

422
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,040
He's a writer,
which means he's skint.

423
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,230
You get up late these days, Ada.

424
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,350
Mm. I go to bed late.

425
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,950
Yeah? Where's Karl?

426
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,560
What do you want, Tommy?

427
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,710
Oh, God, before you start
sizing him up for a wedding suit,

428
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,430
he's not interested in me...

429
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,990
~ or in girls of any kind.
~ Ada!

430
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,390
What? Tommy won't judge you.

431
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,720
He sure as hell
won't go to the police.

432
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,190
Look, I'll go and get dressed.

433
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,950
James...

434
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,710
I'm Thomas.

435
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,440
Pleased to meet you.

436
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,400
Can I have a minute
with my sister, please?

437
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,400
Yes, of course.

438
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,310
So, does your lodger know your name?

439
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,070
Yeah. Thorne.

440
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,030
You think I'd tell anybody
anything else?

441
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,270
Your Brummie boys
are all over the papers.

442
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,030
Just one last push, eh?
Then you'll go legit?

443
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,710
Just one more obstacle to get round
then it'll all be straight?

444
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,190
Actually, yes.

445
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,670
Personally, I find it quite amusing.

446
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,790
Men like you are becoming
very fashionable down here.

447
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,030
No society party in London
is complete without a gangster

448
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,720
for the girls to go giddy for.

449
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,160
Anyway, what is it that you want?

450
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,600
I don't have any children, Ada...

451
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,880
.. so I have set up a trust fund.

452
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,680
The beneficiaries
will be John's kids and Karl.

453
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,000
In order for Karl to benefit,
I need your signature.

454
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,750
I've...

455
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,470
set up an account.

456
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,640
Money will be transferred
in the event of my death.

457
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,000
It'll set them up for a new life.

458
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,030
Are you sick?

459
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,790
I'm just doing
what any ordinary man would,

460
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,320
putting my affairs in order.

461
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,710
'Did you know they was
going to take the Eden club?

462
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,510
'I know about the Eden club, yes.'

463
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,030
Did you know they were going
to do it before they did it?

464
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,750
Because that's the one
who's in charge, isn't it?

465
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,550
The one who knows before it happens.

466
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,670
I know what I know, you know.

467
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,590
If you don't know,
then you don't fucking know, do you?

468
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,190
Did you know they was going
to take Wimbledon dogs?

469
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,480
Harringay? The trotting tracks?

470
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,190
Talk, all right?
I genuinely want to hear you.

471
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,590
You've lost control, Alfie.

472
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,990
Have I?

473
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
Everybody knows.

474
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,480
~ Talk to me, Alfie.
~ Talk to you?

475
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,510
All right, I'll talk to you. I'll
fucking tell you how it was, right?

476
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,040
What happened was this.

477
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,510
All the time you were talking about
dirty fucking Jews.

478
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,990
All the fucking time -
dirty fucking Jews, dirty Kikes,

479
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,430
~ dirty dustbin lids... ~ Everyone makes
jokes. ~ You want to talk about

480
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,270
~ not getting into places?
~ Everybody makes fucking jokes.

481
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,710
I didn't know you had
no sense of humour!

482
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,670
And I ain't going to FUCKING mention,
right,

483
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,040
the great big
fuck off elephant in the room.

484
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,950
Look, Alfie...

485
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,750
How many of my bookies
worked Epsom this last May?

486
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,550
None. None.

487
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,430
Not one.

488
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,350
So, for a few fucking jokes
and Epsom,

489
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,910
you fucking invite
a tribe of savages into the city

490
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,920
and just fucking
unlock the fucking gates!

491
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,590
I'm sorry, what are you saying, mate?

492
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,080
I'm saying...

493
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm sorry about the Jew thing.

494
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,270
~ Are you saying you're sorry?
~ Yeah.

495
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,230
~ You're sorry about the Jew thing?
~ Yeah.

496
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,790
~ Really? ~ Yeah.

497
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,640
I want that in writing. Write that
down. He said, "I'm sorry".

498
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,630
And also write down

499
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,350
that all our bookies
can go back to Epsom.

500
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,680
~ He didn't say that.
~ Who's asking you? ~ No.

501
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,350
Write it down.

502
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,790
It's all right. Come on.

503
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,320
Alfie's an old friend.

504
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,280
My friend.

505
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,710
Now, admit it,

506
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,390
the Peaky Blinders
is out of control.

507
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,790
Yeah, they're out
of fucking control, mate.

508
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,160
They come down the canal,
they spread like the fucking clap.

509
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,880
~ Right. So now they're
everybody's problem. ~ Yeah.

510
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,550
~ Alfie. ~ Mm.

511
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,590
~ You and me, we've been fighting
since we was at school. ~ Yeah.

512
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,870
~ All right? Now, also,
we've been friends. ~ Mm, yeah.

513
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,520
You know, it goes
backwards and forwards.

514
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,070
How much better is it
when we're friends?

515
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,870
Oh, it's much better, mate, yeah.

516
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,600
You write that down.

517
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,190
So what we're doing here, right,

518
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,910
is we're writing down some
kind of a deal thing, right?

519
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,990
~ Yeah, a written deal.
~ Written deal, good.

520
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,870
Well, why don't we discuss
the border between the Italians

521
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,590
and the Jews going back
to Farringdon Road.

522
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,230
~ Farringdon Road...
~ Yeah, Farringdon Road. ~ Fuck!

523
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,750
That's ancient history.

524
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,470
~ Write down Farringdon Road.
~ No, no, no, write down Camden Road.

525
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,230
~ Farringdon Road. ~ Camden Road.

526
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,590
~ Write down Farringdon. ~ Camden.
~ Farringdon. ~ Camden.

527
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,120
Write down Camden Road.

528
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,350
Just write down "peace".

529
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,830
Just write down "peace", right,

530
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,920
between the Jews and the Italians.

531
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,190
And war...

532
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,120
against the gypsies.

533
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,600
Fuck.

534
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,000
Mr Thomas Shelby, madam.

535
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,880
Nice house.

536
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,990
Would you like a whisky?

537
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,630
Scotch or Irish?

538
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,390
Irish.

539
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,870
Sorry for the short notice.

540
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,560
I was... passing.

541
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,110
We're not quite
on the Birmingham road.

542
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,910
It was a small diversion.

543
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,470
60 miles - I checked.

544
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,440
That's a small diversion these days.

545
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,870
So, I'm a small diversion.

546
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,160
Good.

547
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,830
Your horse is still out
on the gallops,

548
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,590
but I had Mickey
prepare this report.

549
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,360
You can read it now if you'd like,
then we can go see her.

550
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,950
Is there enough light
for you to read?

551
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,280
Yes, it's fine.

552
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,320
It's getting quite late.

553
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,310
Mickey says she has
the lungs of an elephant.

554
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,110
She's nimble in the heavy going,

555
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,390
but bounces a little
on the hard ground.

556
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,320
Sorry, I'll let you read.

557
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,550
So, he thinks she'll favour
good to soft ground, eh?

558
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,510
~ A little juice in the grass. ~ Mm.

559
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,360
Well, that's good for Epsom.

560
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,040
Does he think she's
not good enough for Epsom?

561
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,390
She needs a lot of work.

562
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,560
The race board will need convincing.

563
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,760
~ I imagine you have some influence.
~ Mm.

564
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,120
That's the suggested programme
for the next two months.

565
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,430
Your glass is empty.

566
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,960
It's fine.

567
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,560
Are you hungry?

568
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,350
Yes, a bit.

569
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,720
I can prepare something.

570
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,480
Do you have engine oil?

571
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,120
Before I set off for Birmingham,
the car needs oil.

572
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,350
I'm sure my husband
kept some in the garage.

573
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,390
I can get someone to do it.

574
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,280
This evening or tomorrow?

575
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,520
Well, we're so far from anywhere,
people usually stay over.

576
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,510
Especially before cars,
when it was just carriages,

577
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,680
people used to stay over
all the time.

578
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,400
But I have a car.

579
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,790
Yes.

580
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,070
And you have...

581
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,680
engine oil.

582
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,600
Probably.

583
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,680
But it would be very usual.

584
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,400
What would?

585
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,230
For a guest to stay.

586
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,830
We have a whole wing
called the guest wing.

587
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,320
Oh, you...

588
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,200
You have a guest wing.

589
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,560
Well...

590
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,840
May.

591
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,110
Have a smoke.

592
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,800
Thank you.

593
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,880
Ignore this. It's actually all right.

594
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,560
I put all his photos
in a drawer and locked it...

595
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
.. as if that was going
to make a difference.

596
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm like a fucking lighthouse
keeper...

597
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,360
.. out here on my own...

598
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,750
.. keeping his flame burning.

599
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,510
But, of course,
when anyone sees a lighthouse

600
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,640
they stay clear, don't they?

601
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,920
Now, do you have a map?

602
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,800
Of the house. Do you have a map?

603
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,200
Because I'm not going to be able
to find my way in the dark.

604
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,510
You see, at midnight,

605
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,430
I'm going to leave my wing

606
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,600
and I'm going to come find you.

607
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,470
And I'm going to turn the handle
of your bedroom door

608
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,510
without making a sound

609
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,680
and none of the maids will know.

610
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,360
You don't know maids.

611
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,270
They hear a pin drop?

612
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,110
If there's a man in the house,
they listen.

613
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,600
They take turns.

614
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,480
So, let them listen.

615
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,630
Right. Day rate, seven shillings.
Loading, unloading.

616
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,880
Night rate, three. Total ten.

617
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,070
Let's go and get a drink.

618
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,470
No, I'm all right.

619
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,070
Come on, it's payday.

620
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,830
Everybody has a drink on payday.

621
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,310
Not me.

622
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,310
You think your mum
don't have a drink on payday?

623
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,320
You think the Lord Almighty
don't have a drink on payday?

624
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,110
Man, it's on fire out there,

625
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,190
women from the BSA offices, honest.

626
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,070
They go out on their own
without their men these days,

627
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,440
in twos and threes now.

628
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,360
Mickey, they go out in twos and
threes and buy their own drinks.

629
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,640
The Marquis, that's where the BSA
secretaries go.

630
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,480
Look, they won't serve a black man
without a Shelby by his side.

631
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,120
So you're using me?

632
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,670
Yeah.

633
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,080
Come on.

634
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,070
I told you, I fucking told you,
this city's gone mad.

635
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,760
Girls go out on their own now.

636
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,030
Two pints of dark mild, please.

637
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,710
Fuck that. We're Peaky boys.

638
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,160
Two whiskies.

639
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,760
You get used to it,
then you can't stop.

640
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,830
I don't drink with blacks.

641
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,470
Here we fucking go.

642
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,830
Paddy, they're OK.

643
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,550
Not with me, they're not.

644
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,590
I don't drink in pubs with blacks.

645
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,960
So leave.

646
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,550
Look, my dad
is the preacher round here.

647
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,870
He has connections, ask anybody.

648
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,430
I couldn't give a fuck who he is.

649
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,270
I'm telling you to leave it, Paddy.

650
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,750
And I'm telling this darkie
to get out of here.

651
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,230
You know something? Fuck off.

652
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,030
It's all right, Isaiah,
come on, leave it.

653
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,360
~ We'll go to my cousin's pub.
~ I like it here.

654
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,840
You fucking nigger.

655
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,710
Paddy!
The white kid's a Peaky Blinder!

656
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,560
He's Polly Shelby's son!

657
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,550
He's Polly Shelby's son!
Are you fucking suicidal?!

658
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,510
Sir...

659
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,230
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

660
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,870
Get out!

661
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,310
Get out the fucking pub.

662
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,070
I really didn't know.

663
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,240
Fuck, let's go. Let's go!

664
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,550
We ordered some drinks

665
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,560
and we're going to drink them.

666
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,070
His face, man.
Did you see his fucking face?

667
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,910
You punch like a fucking kangaroo.

668
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,920
I seen one once in a circus,
you punch like that.

669
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,990
All right, anyway,
I need a fucking drink.

670
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,790
~ It's on you.
~ It's on me? You just got paid.

671
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,240
Yeah, from you.

672
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,070
Fucking hell,
it's packed in here, isn't it?

673
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,790
So it's as easy as that?

674
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,190
Easy as that, John boy.
London, you wouldn't believe it.

675
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,190
Finn, stick your head in a bucket.

676
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,470
No.

677
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,230
The women, John boy, the women...

678
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,750
I've got this one,
she's a dancer, right?

679
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,600
She can do things with her...

680
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,150
If Finn would just piss off
I'd explain a little bit better.

681
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,710
Well, if it's so good,
why are you here?

682
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,590
A decent pint.

683
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,350
The cockney's can't get that right.

684
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,880
He misses us, Finn,
that's what it is.

685
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,360
Here they are, look,
junior Peaky boys.

686
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,230
What's happened to you?
You been scrapping?

687
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,790
Some idiots at the Marquis of Lorne.

688
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,350
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

689
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,830
We fought them off.

690
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,510
Arthur, we had to stand
our ground and we did.

691
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,160
The Marquis, eh? Where's your dad?

692
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
~ Preaching. ~ Right.

693
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,270
Don't nick any of me chips, Finn!

694
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,280
~ Where are you going?
~ We won't be long.

695
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,430
Where are they going?

696
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,720
The Marquis of Lorne.

697
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,430
Shame.

698
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,070
It was a nice pub.

You didn't have to do that for me.

723
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,670
We didn't do it for you, Michael.

724
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,880
We did it for the good name
of the company.

725
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,390
None of this happened, all right?

726
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,400
Come on, let's go
and get that drink.

727
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,760
The date has been set.

728

Three weeks from today.

729
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,840
You checked out his house?

730
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,360
There's coppers all over it.

731
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,910
You'll take care of them?

732
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,470
No. That would arouse suspicion.

733
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,800
You'll have to deal
with them yourself.

734
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,840
And if a copper gets killed?

735
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,070
There will be no consequences
for you, I have given you my word.

736
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,800
Which I know to be worthless.

737
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,080
That is why I have been settling
my affairs in the event of my death.

738
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,480
And making your peace
with God, perhaps?

739
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,680
Well, good luck with that.

740
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,480
I have made arrangements
